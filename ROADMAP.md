# CODEX Development Roadmap

**Project Status:** Pre-v0.1.0 (Phase 2 Week 4 Complete)
**Source:** Based on BMAD vs CODEX Comprehensive Analysis (docs/v0.1-Plan/)

---

## v0.1.0 - Quality Foundation

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
**Scope:** 128-174 hours of work identified in gap analysis
**Theme:** Comprehensive quality gates, feedback loops, and validation infrastructure

### Completed (Phase 2 Week 4) âœ…

**Foundation:**
1. âœ… Comprehensive quality gates at all phase transitions (5 checklists: 15-169 items each)
2. âœ… Quality-gate agent with evidence-based validation (0-100 scoring)
3. âœ… Discovery enrichment (3â†’9 questions) & persistence
4. âœ… Analyst enhancements (variable extraction, 4 restored sections)
5. âœ… PM critical fixes (checklist, format, AI sizing, vertical slice)
6. âœ… Architect template enhancements (frontend architecture, testing strategy, platform selection, error handling, confidence scoring)

**Iteration:**
7. âœ… Feedback request protocol (PMâ†”Architect, PRPâ†”Execution)
8. âœ… Epic-based incremental workflow (architecture & PRPs per-epic, not all upfront)
9. âœ… PRP enhancements (validation enforcement, failure escalation)
10. âœ… QA review agent (post-implementation quality)
11. âœ… Execution learning feedback loop & PRP versioning
12. âœ… Architect validation infrastructure (zero-knowledge test, comprehensive checklist, confidence scoring, handoff improvements)

## Gap Categories (Reference)

Based on comprehensive analysis, 70+ gaps identified across workflows:

**P0 - Critical Gaps:**
- Analyst: Semantic expansion, discovery persistence
- PM: Validation task, brownfield support, product owner layer, menu format
- Architect: Frontend architecture, testing strategy, validation checklist
- PRP: Pre-flight validation, Archon integration, validation commands, failure escalation, feedback loops

**P1 - High Priority Gaps:**
- Analyst: Template variables, BMAD sections, elicitation continuity
- PM: Document sharding, architect feedback, AI sizing, vertical slice
- Architect: Additional validation improvements
- PRP: TodoWrite consistency, state persistence, research quality, automated scoring

**P2-P3 - Enhancement Gaps:**
- Various workflow optimizations
- Advanced features
- Quality-of-life improvements

---

## Implementation Principles

### Quality First
- Every phase transition must have validation gates
- Quality metrics drive implementation decisions
- Real-world testing validates each release

### Iterative Development
- Build foundation before advanced features
- Validate with real projects before expanding
- Epic-based incremental approach

### Community Driven
- Roadmap adjusts based on real usage
- Transparent development process
- Open to contributions and feedback
