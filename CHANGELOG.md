## [Unreleased]

Current development version (pre-v0.1.0) - Core infrastructure complete, entering testing phase.

### Added

- Comprehensive BMAD vs CODEX workflow analysis integrating 6 parallel agent reviews (111K document)
  - Identified 70+ gaps across analyst, PM, architect, and PRP workflows
  - Introduced epic-based incremental workflow pattern (architecture & PRPs created per-epic, not all upfront)
  - Defined v0.1.0 roadmap: 114-156 hours focused on quality foundations with comprehensive quality gates
  - Deferred brownfield support to v0.2.0 to focus on greenfield MVP excellence
  - Reorganized gap analysis documents into references-docs/ subfolder for improved navigation
- Comprehensive v0.1.0 gap analysis documentation for analyst, PM, and PRD creation workflows
- Persistent orchestrator architecture with dedicated discovery agent for improved workflow coordination
- ULTRATHINK mandatory planning phase for systematic PRP implementation
- Final validation completion checklist for comprehensive pre-QA verification
- Enhanced QA validations: code quality metrics, requirement traceability, documentation validation
- Smart commit command with automatic CHANGELOG.md integration
- Professional project README with comprehensive project overview, installation guide, and usage examples
- Project CHANGELOG following Keep a Changelog format
- GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Universal elicitation enforcement system with standardized 1-9 menu format across all agents
- 5-level progressive validation system (Level 0: Elicitation, Levels 1-4: Technical validation)
- Operation mode support: Interactive (default), Batch, and YOLO modes with mode switching commands
- Runtime state management with `workflow.json` persistence for workflow recovery
- Smart discovery flow with context-aware questioning and conditional project name prompt
- Comprehensive mode-awareness across all workflow agents (analyst, PM, architect)
- Generic workflow template (`greenfield-generic.yaml`) for multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.)
- State manager task (`state-manager.md`) for runtime state operations and validation
- Phase validation task (`validate-phase.md`) with hard enforcement at transitions
- Advanced elicitation task with intelligent method selection based on content context
- Brownfield enhancement workflow for existing codebase feature additions
- Health check workflow for system validation
- Context handoff validation for zero-knowledge architecture
- PRP quality check task with 3-gate validation system
- Workflow customization guide for language-specific configuration
- Elicitation history tracking in workflow state
- Development Context as standard discovery question
- Mode propagation throughout agent transformations
- ULTRATHINK planning phase for systematic PRP construction
- Validation command verification to prevent broken PRPs
- 3-gate quality validation system with confidence scoring
- Verbatim output pass-through (orchestrator no longer reformats agent output)

### Changed

- Simplified architecture by removing Swift agent dependencies (feature-developer, syntax-reviewer, etc.)
- Replaced agent-based Level 4 validation with direct command execution (swiftlint, swift test, xcodebuild)
- Updated elicitation menu from confusing 0-8+9 format to intuitive 1-9 pattern with option 1 = "Proceed to next section"
- Enhanced orchestrator with pre-launch validation protocol requiring Level 0 checks before agent activation
- Improved workflow initialization UX by removing redundant "Proceed with discovery phase?" confirmation
- Enhanced PRP creator with ULTRATHINK planning phase and verification of validation commands
- Streamlined PRP creation by removing mandatory elicitation process for faster generation
- Modernized all workflow YAML files with standardized mode documentation
- Updated validation command execution mechanism for language-agnostic support
- Enhanced orchestrator to pass agent output verbatim (no reformatting or summarization)
- Improved create-doc task with full content presentation requirements

### Fixed

- Orchestrator auto-spawning next section without waiting for user input in interactive mode
- Project brief template elicit flags (sections 6-8 now require elicitation)
- Analyst agent bypassing elicitation in interactive mode (was using batch processing incorrectly)
- Redundant PROCEED/WAIT confirmation after discovery elicitation menu selection
- Multiple file creation instead of enforced single file output from templates
- Summary presentation instead of full content display in analyst outputs
- Orchestrator reformatting agent output instead of verbatim pass-through
- Workflow execution rule enforcement across analyst, PM, and architect agents
- Elicitation menu format violations (agents using option 0 or incorrect numbering)
- Mode detection and pattern selection in agent workflows
- Runtime state initialization during discovery phase (was missing mandatory checks)
- Validation gate enforcement to prevent phase transition without completed elicitation
- Workflow.json path references in state manager task
