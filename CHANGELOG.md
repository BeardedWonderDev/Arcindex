## [Unreleased]

Current development version (pre-v0.1.0) - Core infrastructure complete, entering testing phase.

### Added

- Project CHANGELOG following Keep a Changelog format
- GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- Universal elicitation enforcement system with standardized 1-9 menu format across all agents

- Operation mode support: Interactive (default), Batch, and YOLO modes with mode switching commands
- Runtime state management with `workflow.json` persistence for workflow recovery
- Smart discovery flow with context-aware questioning and conditional project name prompt
- Comprehensive mode-awareness across all workflow agents (analyst, PM, architect)
- Generic workflow template (`greenfield-generic.yaml`) for multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.)
- State manager task (`state-manager.md`) for runtime state operations and validation
- Phase validation task (`validate-phase.md`) with hard enforcement at transitions

- Mode propagation throughout agent transformations
- ULTRATHINK planning phase for systematic PRP construction
- Validation command verification to prevent broken PRPs
- 3-gate quality validation system with confidence scoring
- Verbatim output pass-through (orchestrator no longer reformats agent output)

### Changed

- Simplified architecture by removing Swift agent dependencies (feature-developer, syntax-reviewer, etc.)
- Replaced agent-based Level 4 validation with direct command execution (swiftlint, swift test, xcodebuild)
- Updated elicitation menu from confusing 0-8+9 format to intuitive 1-9 pattern with option 1 = "Proceed to next section"
- Enhanced orchestrator with pre-launch validation protocol requiring Level 0 checks before agent activation
- Improved workflow initialization UX by removing redundant "Proceed with discovery phase?" confirmation
- Enhanced PRP creator with ULTRATHINK planning phase and verification of validation commands
- Streamlined PRP creation by removing mandatory elicitation process for faster generation
- Modernized all workflow YAML files with standardized mode documentation
- Updated validation command execution mechanism for language-agnostic support
- Enhanced orchestrator to pass agent output verbatim (no reformatting or summarization)
- Improved create-doc task with full content presentation requirements

### Fixed

- Analyst agent bypassing elicitation in interactive mode (was using batch processing incorrectly)
- Redundant PROCEED/WAIT confirmation after discovery elicitation menu selection
- Multiple file creation instead of enforced single file output from templates
- Summary presentation instead of full content display in analyst outputs
- Orchestrator reformatting agent output instead of verbatim pass-through
- Workflow execution rule enforcement across analyst, PM, and architect agents
- Elicitation menu format violations (agents using option 0 or incorrect numbering)
- Mode detection and pattern selection in agent workflows
- Runtime state initialization during discovery phase (was missing mandatory checks)
- Validation gate enforcement to prevent phase transition without completed elicitation
- Workflow.json path references in state manager task
