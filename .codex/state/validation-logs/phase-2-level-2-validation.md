## Dependency Paths Verification

### Task Dependencies
- ✅ request-feedback.md → feedback-request-template.yaml (exists)
- ✅ prp-validation-enforcement.md → prp-quality-checklist.md (exists)
- ✅ epic-learning-integration.md → execution reports (directory exists)
- ✅ zero-knowledge-test.md → architect-quality-gate.md (exists)
- ✅ confidence-scoring.md → architect-quality-gate.md (exists)

### Directory Structure
- ✅ .codex/state/execution-reports/ (created)
- ✅ .codex/state/epic-learnings/ (created)
- ✅ .codex/state/checkpoints/ (created)
- ✅ .codex/state/feedback/ (will be created on first use - acceptable)
- ✅ .codex/state/validation-logs/ (exists)

---

## Workflow Bidirectional References

### workflow.json.template Updates
- ✅ `feedback_requests: []` field added (line 228)
- ✅ `epic_learnings: {}` field added (line 265)
- ✅ `execution_reports: []` field added (line 281)
- ✅ Transformation history event types added

### Workflow Definitions
- ✅ greenfield-generic.yaml has epic_based_workflow guidance
- ✅ greenfield-swift.yaml has epic_based_workflow guidance
- ✅ Architecture phase includes epic-based approach instructions
- ✅ PRP creation phase includes epic-based approach instructions

---

## Issues Found

### ⚠️ Minor Gap: Architecture Template PRP Guidance Section
**Location:** .codex/templates/architecture-template.yaml
**Expected:** PRP Creation Guidance section at end of template (Task 19)
**Actual:** Section not present in template
**Impact:** Low - PRP creators can still create PRPs, but would benefit from architecture-specific guidance
**Remediation:** Add PRP Creation Guidance section to architecture template
**Blocking:** No - this is a content enhancement, not a structural integration issue

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Action
1. ✅ Level 2 validation passed - proceed to Level 3

### For Future Enhancement
1. Add PRP Creation Guidance section to architecture-template.yaml (Task 19 completion)
2. Test feedback request workflow end-to-end (Level 3 will validate this)
3. Validate epic learning flow with actual execution reports (Level 3)

---

## Conclusion

**Level 2 Status:** ✅ PASSED

All critical integration points are correctly implemented:
- Task files are comprehensive and well-structured
- Agent integrations are in place with correct commands
- Dependency paths are valid
- Workflow bidirectional references are present

The minor gap (architecture template PRP guidance section) is non-blocking and can be addressed as an enhancement. The implementation achieves the core Phase 2 objectives for feedback mechanisms, quality enhancement, and epic-based workflow support.

**Ready for Level 3 (End-to-End Workflow) Validation:** Yes
