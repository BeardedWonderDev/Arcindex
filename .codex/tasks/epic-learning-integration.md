  required:
    completed_epic:
      type: integer
      description: "Epic number that was just completed"
      example: 1

    next_epic:

```

## Prerequisites

```yaml
prerequisites:
  - Epic N implementation complete
  - Execution reports exist for Epic N (.codex/state/execution-reports/epic-{N}-*.json)
  - Epic N+1 requirements defined in PRD
  - PRP creator ready to create Epic N+1 PRPs
```

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Collect Epic N Execution Reports

```bash
echo "üìä Collecting execution reports for Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC..."

# Find all execution reports for the completed epic
REPORT_FILES=(.codex/state/execution-reports/epic-${COMPLETED_EPIC}-story-*.json)

if [ ${#REPORT_FILES[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ERROR: No execution reports found for Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC"
    echo "   Expected location: .codex/state/execution-reports/epic-${COMPLETED_EPIC}-story-*.json"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Found ${#REPORT_FILES[@]} execution reports for Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC"
```

### Step 2: Extract Common Patterns

```bash
echo ""
echo "üîç Analyzing patterns across Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC..."

# Initialize pattern collections
SUCCESSFUL_PATTERNS=()
FAILED_PATTERNS=()
PRP_GAPS=()
VALIDATION_ISSUES=()
TIME_VARIANCES=()

# Analyze each report
for REPORT_FILE in "${REPORT_FILES[@]}"; do
    # Extract successful patterns
    PATTERNS=$(jq -r '.patterns_that_worked[]?.pattern // empty' "$REPORT_FILE")
    if [ -n "$PATTERNS" ]; then
        while IFS= read -r pattern; do
            SUCCESSFUL_PATTERNS+=("$pattern")
        done <<< "$PATTERNS"
    fi
    
    # Extract PRP quality issues
    PRP_ISSUES=$(jq -r '.prp_quality_issues[]?.issue // empty' "$REPORT_FILE")
    if [ -n "$PRP_ISSUES" ]; then
        while IFS= read -r issue; do
            PRP_GAPS+=("$issue")
        done <<< "$PRP_ISSUES"
    fi
    
    # Extract validation issues
    for LEVEL in 0 1 2 3 4; do
        LEVEL_ISSUES=$(jq -r ".validation_results.level_${LEVEL}.issues[]? // empty" "$REPORT_FILE")
        if [ -n "$LEVEL_ISSUES" ]; then
            while IFS= read -r issue; do
                VALIDATION_ISSUES+=("Level $LEVEL: $issue")
            done <<< "$LEVEL_ISSUES"
        fi
    done
    
    # Calculate time variance
    ESTIMATED=$(jq -r '.estimated_duration_hours // 0' "$REPORT_FILE")
    ACTUAL=$(jq -r '.actual_duration_hours // 0' "$REPORT_FILE")
    if [ "$ESTIMATED" != "0" ] && [ "$ACTUAL" != "0" ]; then
        VARIANCE=$(echo "scale=2; ($ACTUAL - $ESTIMATED) / $ESTIMATED * 100" | bc)
        TIME_VARIANCES+=("${VARIANCE}%")
    fi
done

echo "‚úÖ Pattern extraction complete"
echo "   Successful patterns: ${#SUCCESSFUL_PATTERNS[@]}"
echo "   PRP gaps identified: ${#PRP_GAPS[@]}"
echo "   Validation issues: ${#VALIDATION_ISSUES[@]}"
```

### Step 3: Identify Common Issues

```bash
echo ""
echo "üéØ Identifying common issues..."

# Find most common PRP gaps (frequency analysis)
COMMON_GAPS=$(printf '%s\n' "${PRP_GAPS[@]}" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5)

echo ""
echo "Top 5 Common PRP Gaps:"
echo "$COMMON_GAPS"

# Find most common validation issues
COMMON_VALIDATION=$(printf '%s\n' "${VALIDATION_ISSUES[@]}" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5)

echo ""
echo "Top 5 Common Validation Issues:"
echo "$COMMON_VALIDATION"
```

### Step 4: Calculate Average Time Variance

```bash
echo ""
echo "‚è±Ô∏è  Time Estimate Analysis..."

if [ ${#TIME_VARIANCES[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    # Calculate average time variance
    TOTAL_VARIANCE=0
    for VARIANCE in "${TIME_VARIANCES[@]}"; do
        # Remove % sign and add to total
        VARIANCE_NUM=$(echo "$VARIANCE" | sed 's/%//')
        TOTAL_VARIANCE=$(echo "$TOTAL_VARIANCE + $VARIANCE_NUM" | bc)
    done
    AVG_VARIANCE=$(echo "scale=2; $TOTAL_VARIANCE / ${#TIME_VARIANCES[@]}" | bc)
    
    echo "Average time estimate variance: ${AVG_VARIANCE}%"
    
    if (( $(echo "$AVG_VARIANCE > 20" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Time estimates consistently off by more than 20%"
        echo "   Recommendation: Adjust Epic $NEXT_EPIC estimates upward"
    fi
else
    echo "No time variance data available"
fi
```

### Step 5: Generate Learning Summary

```bash
echo ""
echo "üìù Generating learning summary for Epic $NEXT_EPIC..."

LEARNING_FILE=".codex/state/epic-learnings/epic-${COMPLETED_EPIC}-learning-summary.md"
mkdir -p .codex/state/epic-learnings

cat > "$LEARNING_FILE" <<EOF

CHECKLIST_FILE=".codex/state/epic-learnings/epic-${NEXT_EPIC}-integration-checklist.md"

cat > "$CHECKLIST_FILE" <<EOF
# Epic $NEXT_EPIC Learning Integration Checklist

**Source:** Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC Execution Learnings  
**Created:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%6NZ")

Use this checklist when creating Epic $NEXT_EPIC PRPs to ensure Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC learnings are applied.

---

## Pre-PRP Creation Review

- [ ] Read Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC learning summary: $LEARNING_FILE
- [ ] Review top 3 successful patterns
- [ ] Note all PRP gaps to avoid
- [ ] Check time estimate variance guidance

---

## During PRP Creation

### Context Section

- [ ] Add gotchas from Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC to "Known Gotchas of our codebase"
- [ ] Reference Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC execution reports for similar stories

### File References
$(if [ ${#PRP_GAPS[@]} -gt 0 ] && echo "${PRP_GAPS[@]}" | grep -q "file\|path\|reference"; then
    echo "- [ ] Verify every file reference exists (Issue identified in Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC)"
    echo "- [ ] Use absolute paths from project root"
    echo "- [ ] Test file accessibility with Read tool"
else
    echo "- [ ] Verify file references (standard check)"
fi)

    echo "- [ ] Test all validation commands (Issues found in Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC)"
    echo "- [ ] Include verification log section"
    echo "- [ ] Document command prerequisites"
else
    echo "- [ ] Verify validation commands work"
fi)

### Time Estimates
$(if [ -n "$AVG_VARIANCE" ]; then
    if (( $(echo "$AVG_VARIANCE > 20" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "- [ ] Adjust estimates upward by ${AVG_VARIANCE}% (Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC ran over)"
    elif (( $(echo "$AVG_VARIANCE < -20" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "- [ ] Review estimates, Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC ran under by ${AVG_VARIANCE}%"
    else
        echo "- [ ] Time estimates were accurate in Epic $COMPLETED_EPIC"
    fi
fi)

---

## Post-PRP Creation Validation

## Integration with PRP Creator

PRP Creator should invoke this task before creating Epic N+1 PRPs:

```yaml
prp_creator_workflow:
  1_check_epic:
    condition: "Creating PRPs for Epic N where N > 1"
    action: "Check if Epic N-1 complete"

  2_integrate_learnings:
    condition: "Epic N-1 complete"
    action: "Execute epic-learning-integration.md"
    inputs:
      completed_epic: "N-1"
      next_epic: "N"

  3_review_summary:
    action: "Read learning summary file"
    checklist: "Review integration checklist"

  4_create_prps:
    action: "Create Epic N PRPs with learnings applied"
    validation: "Verify learnings integrated via checklist"
```

## Success Criteria

```yaml
success_indicators:
  - Learning summary generated for Epic N
  - Integration checklist created for Epic N+1
  - Patterns extracted and documented
  - PRP gaps identified and remediation provided
  - Time variance calculated and recommendations made
  - workflow.json updated with learnings
  - Files accessible to PRP Creator
```

## Anti-Patterns

```yaml
anti_patterns:
  skip_learning_review:
    bad: "Start Epic N+1 PRPs immediately without reviewing Epic N learnings"
    good: "Always review learning summary before creating next epic's PRPs"

  ignore_patterns:
    bad: "Successful patterns noted but not applied"
    good: "Explicitly integrate successful patterns into Epic N+1 PRPs"

  repeat_mistakes:
    bad: "PRP gaps from Epic N repeated in Epic N+1"
    good: "Use integration checklist to verify all gaps addressed"
```
