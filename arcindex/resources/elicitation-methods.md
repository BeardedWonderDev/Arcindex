# Elicitation Methods Data

*Adapted from BMAD™ Core for CODEX workflow integration*

## Core Reflective Methods

**Expand or Contract for Audience**

- Ask whether to 'expand' (add detail, elaborate) or 'contract' (simplify, clarify)
- Identify specific target audience if relevant
- Tailor content complexity and depth accordingly
- Consider implementation readiness and zero-knowledge validation needs

**Explain Reasoning (CoT Step-by-Step)**

- Walk through the step-by-step thinking process
- Reveal underlying assumptions and decision points
- Show how conclusions were reached from current role's perspective
- Document decision rationale for workflow context preservation

**Critique and Refine**

- Review output for flaws, inconsistencies, or improvement areas
- Identify specific weaknesses from role's expertise
- Suggest refined version reflecting domain knowledge
- Apply CODEX quality standards and validation criteria

## Structural Analysis Methods

**Analyze Logical Flow and Dependencies**

- Examine content structure for logical progression
- Check internal consistency and coherence
- Identify and validate dependencies between elements
- Confirm effective ordering and sequencing
- Validate against workflow phase requirements

**Assess Alignment with Overall Goals**

- Evaluate content contribution to stated objectives
- Identify any misalignments or gaps
- Interpret alignment from specific role's perspective
- Suggest adjustments to better serve goals
- Ensure compatibility with enhanced PRP creation

## Risk and Challenge Methods

**Identify Potential Risks and Unforeseen Issues**

- Brainstorm potential risks from role's expertise
- Identify overlooked edge cases or scenarios
- Anticipate unintended consequences
- Highlight implementation challenges
- Consider context breakpoint and handoff risks

**Challenge from Critical Perspective**

- Adopt critical stance on current content
- Play devil's advocate from specified viewpoint
- Argue against proposal highlighting weaknesses
- Apply YAGNI principles when appropriate (scope trimming)
- Test against "No Prior Knowledge" validation criteria

## Creative Exploration Methods

**Tree of Thoughts Deep Dive**

- Break problem into discrete "thoughts" or intermediate steps
- Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously
- Use self-evaluation to classify each path as "sure", "likely", or "impossible"
- Apply search algorithms (BFS/DFS) to find optimal solution paths
- Optimize for one-pass implementation success

**Hindsight is 20/20: The 'If Only...' Reflection**

- Imagine retrospective scenario based on current content
- Identify the one "if only we had known/done X..." insight
- Describe imagined consequences humorously or dramatically
- Extract actionable learnings for current context
- Apply lessons to workflow improvement

## Multi-Persona Collaboration Methods

**Agile Team Perspective Shift**

- Rotate through different Scrum team member viewpoints
- Product Owner: Focus on user value and business impact
- Scrum Master: Examine process flow and team dynamics
- Developer: Assess technical implementation and complexity
- QA: Identify testing scenarios and quality concerns
- Architect: Evaluate technical design and scalability

**Stakeholder Round Table**

- Convene virtual meeting with multiple personas
- Each persona contributes unique perspective on content
- Identify conflicts and synergies between viewpoints
- Synthesize insights into actionable recommendations
- Generate consensus for workflow progression

**Meta-Prompting Analysis**

- Step back to analyze the structure and logic of current approach
- Question the format and methodology being used
- Suggest alternative frameworks or mental models
- Optimize the elicitation process itself
- Align with CODEX orchestration principles

## CODEX-Enhanced Methods

**Workflow Context Integration**

- Evaluate content contribution to overall workflow success
- Identify context preservation requirements for handoffs
- Assess zero-knowledge validation compatibility
- Optimize for fresh Claude instance comprehension
- Ensure implementation-ready specificity

**Language Agent Coordination Perspective**

- Consider how content will be enhanced by language agents
- Identify coordination points with specialized agents
- Evaluate compatibility with progressive validation gates
- Optimize for parallel agent execution
- Plan for agent feedback integration

**Implementation Success Optimization**

- Focus on one-pass implementation success probability
- Identify potential implementation blockers or ambiguities
- Optimize for developer productivity and quality
- Consider validation command effectiveness
- Enhance for production-readiness

## Advanced 2025 Techniques

**Self-Consistency Validation**

- Generate multiple reasoning paths for same problem
- Compare consistency across different approaches
- Identify most reliable and robust solution
- Highlight areas where approaches diverge and why
- Apply to CODEX context completeness validation

**ReWOO (Reasoning Without Observation)**

- Separate parametric reasoning from tool-based actions
- Create reasoning plan without external dependencies
- Identify what can be solved through pure reasoning
- Optimize for efficiency and reduced token usage
- Enable context breakpoint optimization

**Persona-Pattern Hybrid**

- Combine specific role expertise with elicitation pattern
- Architect + Risk Analysis: Deep technical risk assessment
- UX Expert + User Journey: End-to-end experience critique
- PM + Stakeholder Analysis: Multi-perspective impact review
- PRP Creator + Zero Knowledge: Implementation readiness validation

**Emergent Collaboration Discovery**

- Allow multiple perspectives to naturally emerge
- Identify unexpected insights from persona interactions
- Explore novel combinations of viewpoints
- Capture serendipitous discoveries from multi-agent thinking
- Enhance workflow orchestration effectiveness

## Game-Based Elicitation Methods

**Red Team vs Blue Team**

- Red Team: Attack the proposal, find vulnerabilities
- Blue Team: Defend and strengthen the approach
- Competitive analysis reveals blind spots
- Results in more robust, battle-tested solutions
- Apply to validation gate effectiveness

**Innovation Tournament**

- Pit multiple alternative approaches against each other
- Score each approach across different criteria
- Crowd-source evaluation from different personas
- Identify winning combination of features
- Optimize for workflow success metrics

**Escape Room Challenge**

- Present content as constraints to work within
- Find creative solutions within tight limitations
- Identify minimum viable approach
- Discover innovative workarounds and optimizations
- Test context window limitations creatively

## CODEX Quality Gates Integration
