<!-- Powered by CODEXâ„¢ Core -->

# CODEX Command Router

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains the command routing configuration for CODEX orchestration system.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS to understand command routing behavior:

## COMPLETE COMMAND DEFINITION FOLLOWS

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - Dependencies map to .codex/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (agents|workflows|tasks|templates|config|data), name=file-name
  - Example: orchestrator.md â†’ .codex/agents/orchestrator.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when processing specific subcommands

REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match subcommands from $ARGUMENTS flexibly (e.g., "begin"â†’start, "resume"â†’continue), ask for clarification if no clear match.

command-processing-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract subcommand and options
  - STEP 2: Match subcommand to command-routing rules below
  - STEP 3: For each subcommand, follow the specific routing instructions
  - STEP 4: Delegate complex logic to orchestrator agent via Task tool
  - STEP 5: When Task tool returns, display the EXACT agent response to user without modification
  - DO NOT: Execute implementation logic directly in this command
  - DO NOT: Summarize, reformat, or paraphrase the orchestrator's output
  - DO NOT: Add your own commentary or wrap the output in additional text
  - ONLY: Route to appropriate agent or display information
  - CRITICAL: All workflow management happens in orchestrator agent
  - CRITICAL: Show orchestrator output verbatim to preserve formatting and UX

command:
  name: CODEX Router
  id: codex
  title: CODEX Orchestration System Command Router
  icon: ðŸŽ¯
  purpose: Route CODEX commands to orchestrator agent for workflow management

routing:
  role: Command Router & Dispatcher
  responsibility: Parse user commands and delegate to CODEX orchestrator
  core_principles:
    - Parse $ARGUMENTS for subcommand identification
    - Route all workflow logic to orchestrator agent
    - Maintain stateless command processing
    - Provide clear error messages for invalid commands
    - Never implement business logic in this router

subcommands:
  start:
    description: Initialize new CODEX workflow
    arguments: "[workflow-type] [project-name]"
    routing: |
      1. Extract workflow-type and project-name from $ARGUMENTS
      2. Verify .codex/ directory exists
      3. If directory missing: Report "CODEX system not installed. Please ensure .codex/ directory exists."
      4. If no workflow-type: List available workflows from .codex/workflows/
         - greenfield-swift: New Swift/iOS projects
         - greenfield-generic: Any language (Python, JS, Go, Rust, etc.)
         - brownfield-enhancement: Add features to existing projects
         - health-check: Validate CODEX system
      5. Launch orchestrator via Task tool with instructions (see below)
      6. CRITICAL: When Task tool returns, display the orchestrator's EXACT response to user
         - DO NOT add "The CODEX orchestrator has been initialized..." or similar commentary
         - DO NOT reformat or summarize the orchestrator's questions
         - DO NOT add your own introduction or explanation
         - The orchestrator's output is complete and should be shown verbatim
         - Simply pass through the agent response without modification

      Task tool instructions:
         "Activate CODEX orchestrator at .codex/agents/orchestrator.md
          Initialize workflow: {workflow-type}
          Project name: {project-name}

          CRITICAL UX: Present complete initialization status (project info, available commands, current status)
          THEN immediately transition into discovery questions WITHOUT asking 'Proceed with discovery phase?'

          The /codex start command IS the user's confirmation to begin.

          Initialization display should include:
          - Workflow Initialization section (project name, workflow type, operation mode)
          - Available CODEX Commands section (workflow management, operation modes, system management)
          - Current Status section (state, next step)

          Then immediately continue with:
          'Let's begin with discovery questions:'

          CRITICAL: Smart question handling based on provided arguments
          - If {project-name} provided: Skip name question, show as confirmed in init display
          - If {project-name} NOT provided: Ask for name as first question

          Discovery questions to ask:
          - [CONDITIONAL] 'What's your project name/working title?' (ONLY if not provided in command)
          - 'Brief Project Concept: What are you building? (1-3 sentences covering problem, users, core functionality)'
          - 'Existing Inputs: Do you have any existing materials (research, designs, technical requirements), or starting fresh?'
          - 'Development Context: Any technical considerations like target platform, technology preferences, or integration requirements?'

          CRITICAL: DO NOT prompt user to select operation mode during discovery
          - Default to 'interactive' mode automatically
          - Read codex-config.yaml for default_mode if present
          - User can change mode anytime with /codex interactive|batch|yolo commands

          After discovery questions:
          - Create runtime state with default operation_mode using state-manager.md
          - Execute discovery elicitation with 1-9 menu
          - Propagate operation_mode to all agent transformations throughout workflow"
