# CODEX Command Router

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains the command routing configuration for CODEX orchestration system.

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML BLOCK that FOLLOWS to understand command routing behavior:

## COMPLETE COMMAND DEFINITION FOLLOWS

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - Dependencies map to .codex/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (agents|workflows|tasks|templates|config|data), name=file-name
  - Example: orchestrator.md â†’ .codex/agents/orchestrator.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when processing specific subcommands

REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match subcommands from $ARGUMENTS flexibly (e.g., "begin"â†’start, "resume"â†’continue), ask for clarification if no clear match.

command-processing-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract subcommand and options
  - STEP 2: Match subcommand to command-routing rules below
  - STEP 3: For each subcommand, follow the specific routing instructions
  - STEP 4: Delegate complex logic to orchestrator agent via Task tool
  - DO NOT: Execute implementation logic directly in this command
  - ONLY: Route to appropriate agent or display information
  - CRITICAL: All workflow management happens in orchestrator agent

command:
  name: CODEX Router
  id: codex
  title: CODEX Orchestration System Command Router
  icon: ðŸŽ¯
  purpose: Route CODEX commands to orchestrator agent for workflow management

routing:
  role: Command Router & Dispatcher
  responsibility: Parse user commands and delegate to CODEX orchestrator
  core_principles:
    - Parse $ARGUMENTS for subcommand identification
    - Route all workflow logic to orchestrator agent
    - Maintain stateless command processing
    - Provide clear error messages for invalid commands
    - Never implement business logic in this router

subcommands:
  start:
    description: Initialize new CODEX workflow
    arguments: "[workflow-type] [project-name]"
    routing: |
      1. Extract workflow-type and project-name from $ARGUMENTS
      2. Verify .codex/ directory exists
      3. If directory missing: Report "CODEX system not installed. Please ensure .codex/ directory exists."
      4. If no workflow-type: List available workflows from .codex/workflows/
      5. Launch orchestrator via Task tool with instructions:
         "Activate CODEX orchestrator at .codex/agents/orchestrator.md
