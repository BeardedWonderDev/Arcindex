## Category 1: Workflow-Level Integration Tests (12 scenarios, 6-8h)

### Purpose
Validate quality gate triggering, orchestrator integration, and phase transition logic.

### Key Test Groups

**1.1 Quality Gate Triggering (4 scenarios)**
- Discovery → Analyst transition (15-item checklist)
- PM → Architect transition (90-item checklist)
- Architect → PRP transition (169-item checklist)
- PRP → Execution transition (30+ items with validation enforcement)

**1.2 Orchestrator Respecting Gate Results (4 scenarios)**
- APPROVED status (90-100 score) allows progression
- REJECTED status (<70 score) blocks progression
- CONDITIONAL status (70-89 score) requires user confirmation
- Boundary condition: score exactly 90 is APPROVED

**1.3 Workflow YAML Configuration (4 scenarios)**
- YAML correctly defines quality gates for each phase
- Operation mode behavior correctly specified
- Phase transitions reference quality gate results
- Validation requirements align with checklist items

### Critical Validations
- ✓ Quality gates trigger at all 5 phase transitions
- ✓ Orchestrator reads quality_gate_results from workflow.json
- ✓ REJECTED blocks, APPROVED proceeds, CONDITIONAL prompts
- ✓ Workflow YAML configuration correct and consistent

---

## Category 2: End-to-End Workflow Tests (9 scenarios, 10-14h)

### Purpose
Verify complete workflows execute with quality gates across all operation modes.

### Key Test Groups

**2.1 Greenfield-Swift Complete Workflow (3 scenarios)**
1. **Interactive Mode** (4-5h): Section-by-section gate execution with evidence collection
2. **Batch Mode** (3-4h): Comprehensive gate reports at phase end
3. **YOLO Mode** (2-3h): Gates skipped, violations logged

**2.2 Quality Gate Execution Across Phases (3 scenarios)**
- Discovery gate: 15 items, discovery-summary.json validation
- PM gate: 100 items (90 base + 10 story sizing), vertical slice validation
- Architect gate: 184 items (169 base + 15 AI suitability), confidence scoring

**2.3 State Persistence and Recovery (3 scenarios)**
- workflow.json updated after each gate
- Quality gate results persist across sessions
- Separate gate result files created for audit trail

### Critical Validations
- ✓ Complete workflow executes in all 3 operation modes
- ✓ All 5 quality gates execute at correct transitions
- ✓ State persistence works correctly
- ✓ Evidence collection functional in interactive mode
- ✓ YOLO violations logged properly

---

## Category 3: Edge Case Tests (15 scenarios, 8-12h)

### Purpose
Validate system behavior under error conditions, boundary values, and unusual states.

### Key Test Groups

**3.1 Missing or Invalid Data (5 scenarios)**
- Missing quality_gate_results at transition → blocks and prompts
- Corrupted workflow.json → detected, recovery options presented
- Quality gate task execution failure → graceful error handling
- Checklist file invalid format → validation before execution
- Missing evidence in interactive mode → enforcement and retry

**3.2 Boundary Conditions (5 scenarios)**
- Score exactly 90: APPROVED (boundary inclusive)
- Score exactly 89: CONDITIONAL
- Score exactly 70: CONDITIONAL (lower boundary)
- Score exactly 69: REJECTED
- Score 100: perfect score handling
- Score 0: catastrophic failure handling
- Empty checklist (0 items): error detection

**3.3 Concurrent and State Conflicts (5 scenarios)**
- Concurrent gate executions on same phase → lock mechanism
- Gate execution during phase transition → phase locked until complete
- workflow.json modified during gate execution → atomic updates, conflict detection
- Multiple workflows in same directory → isolation verified
- Gate result file timestamp collision → unique naming guaranteed

### Critical Validations
- ✓ All edge cases handled gracefully (no crashes)
- ✓ Error messages clear and actionable
- ✓ Boundary conditions correct (90, 70 thresholds)
- ✓ Concurrent execution safe (no corruption)
- ✓ Recovery mechanisms work

---

## Category 4: Regression Tests (10 scenarios, 4-6h)

### Purpose
Ensure existing CODEX functionality remains intact after quality gate integration.

### Key Test Groups

**4.1 Existing Workflow Compatibility (4 scenarios)**
- Pre-quality-gate workflow.json still works → backward compatibility
- Elicitation enforcement still works → independent of quality gates
- State management intact → all existing functions work
- Agent commands still work → no conflicts with new commands

**4.2 Workflow Execution Consistency (3 scenarios)**
- Health-check workflow still works → no quality gate interference
- Brownfield-enhancement workflow still works → not yet implemented for brownfield
- Generic greenfield workflow still works → alongside greenfield-swift

**4.3 Performance and Resource Usage (3 scenarios)**
- Quality gate execution time acceptable → <30% overhead
- Memory usage acceptable → stable across workflows
- File system impact acceptable → manageable growth

### Critical Validations
- ✓ No regressions in existing workflows
- ✓ Backward compatibility with old workflow.json format
- ✓ Elicitation enforcement unchanged
- ✓ Performance acceptable (<30% overhead)
- ✓ No memory leaks or filesystem issues
