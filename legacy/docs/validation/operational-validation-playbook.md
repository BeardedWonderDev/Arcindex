# Phase 2 Operational Validation Playbook

**Purpose:** Complete guide for validating Phase 2 features through real-world usage

**Audience:** CODEX users ready to test Phase 2 in production projects

**Timeline:** 2-3 projects over 4-12 weeks

---

## Playbook Overview

This playbook guides you through systematic validation of Phase 2 feedback mechanisms and quality enhancements using your real projects. By the end, you'll have quantitative proof of Phase 2's impact on your development workflow.

**Validation Phases:**
1. **Setup** (1 hour) - Prepare for validation
2. **Project 1** (2-4 weeks) - Level 3 operational testing
3. **Project 2** (2-4 weeks) - Refinement and metrics gathering
4. **Project 3** (2-4 weeks) - Level 4 metrics validation
5. **Analysis** (2-3 hours) - Cross-project ROI calculation

**Expected Outcome:** Validated 670-823% ROI (17-21h saved per project)

## Phase 1: Setup (Before First Project)

### Step 1: Verify Phase 2 Installation

```bash
# Run Phase 2 verification script
cat > /tmp/verify-phase2.sh <<'SCRIPT'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Verifying Phase 2 Installation..."
echo ""

# Check task files
echo "Task Files:"

### Step 2: Create Validation Workspace

```bash
# Create validation tracking directory
mkdir -p .codex/state/phase2-validation/{baseline,tracking,reports}

# Create master tracking spreadsheet
cat > .codex/state/phase2-validation/master-tracking.md <<EOF
# Phase 2 Operational Validation Master Tracker

**Start Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
**Target Completion:** $(date -d '+12 weeks' +"%Y-%m-%d" 2>/dev/null || date -v +12w +"%Y-%m-%d" 2>/dev/null || echo "TBD")
**Status:** In Progress

### Step 3: Establish Baseline

**Option A: Use Historical Data**

```bash
# If you have completed CODEX projects before Phase 2
cat > .codex/state/phase2-validation/baseline/historical-baseline.md <<EOF
# Historical Baseline (Pre-Phase 2)

**Projects Analyzed:** [List 2-3 recent projects]
**Date Range:** [Start] to [End]

## Baseline Metrics

### Project Efficiency
- Avg Total Duration: [X hours]
- Avg Rework Hours: [X hours] ([X%] of total)
- Avg Incomplete Handoffs: [X per project]

### Quality Indicators
- PRD Ambiguities Discovered During Implementation: [X per project]
- Architecture Completeness (estimated): [X%]
- PRP Quality (estimated): [X/100]

### Feedback Loops
- Formal Feedback Requests: None (informal communication)
- Avg Time to Resolve Ambiguity: [X hours/days]
- Rework from Late Clarifications: [X hours]

### Failure Handling
- Validation Failures Leading to Restart: [X%]
- Workflow Abandonments: [X per 10 projects]

## Estimated Baseline Efficiency

**Total Hours:** [X]
**Productive Hours:** [Y]
**Efficiency:** [Y/X] = [Z%]

## Notes

[Document any assumptions or estimation methods used]
EOF

echo "✅ Historical baseline documented"
```

**Option B: Create Control Group**

```bash
# If no historical data, run Project 0 WITHOUT Phase 2 features
cat > .codex/state/phase2-validation/baseline/control-project.md <<EOF
# Control Group Project (Phase 2 Disabled)

**Project:** [Name]
**Date:** $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
**Phase 2 Features:** DISABLED (for baseline comparison)

## Tracking

Track same metrics as Phase 2 projects:
- Total duration
- Rework incidents
- Ambiguities found late
- Validation failures
- Quality scores (subjective)

## Results

[To be filled after project completion]
EOF

echo "✅ Control project template created"
```

### Step 4: Review Documentation

```bash
# Read validation guides
echo "📚 Review these guides before starting:"
echo ""
echo "1. Level 3 Testing Guide:"
echo "   docs/validation/level-3-operational-testing-guide.md"
echo ""
echo "2. Level 4 Metrics Guide:"
echo "   docs/validation/level-4-metrics-tracking-guide.md"
echo ""
echo "3. Phase 2 PRP (for reference):"
echo "   PRPs/phase-2-feedback-and-quality-enhancement.md"
echo ""
echo "⏰ Estimated reading time: 45 minutes"
```

## Phase 2: Project 1 - Level 3 Operational Testing

### Pre-Project Briefing

**Before starting Project 1:**

1. **Read Level 3 Testing Guide** (docs/validation/level-3-operational-testing-guide.md)
2. **Identify Test Scenarios:**
   - Which story will test feedback loops? (plant ambiguity in PRD)
   - Which PRP will test validation enforcement? (intentional low quality)
   - Which validation will test failure escalation? (simulate failures)
3. **Create Project Tracking File:**

```bash
PROJECT_NAME="your-project-1"
cp docs/validation/level-3-operational-testing-guide.md \
   .codex/state/phase2-validation/tracking/${PROJECT_NAME}-level3.md
```

---

### During Project 1

**Follow Level 3 Testing Guide scenarios:**

1. **Phases 1-3 (Discovery → PM):** Create PRD with intentional ambiguities
2. **Phase 4 (Architecture):**
   - Test feedback loop: *request-feedback when encountering ambiguity
   - Run zero-knowledge test on architecture
   - Run confidence scoring
3. **Phase 5 (PRP Creation):**
   - Create intentionally low-quality PRP (for testing)
   - Run prp-validation-enforcement
   - Fix issues and re-validate
4. **Phase 6 (Implementation):**
   - Execute capture-execution-learnings at start, per level, and final
   - Simulate validation failures for escalation testing
   - Track all execution learning data

---

### Post-Project 1

**Generate Level 3 Report:**

```bash
# After Project 1 completes
PROJECT_NAME="your-project-1"

# Review all tracked data
cat .codex/state/phase2-validation/tracking/${PROJECT_NAME}-level3.md

# Generate summary
cat > .codex/state/phase2-validation/reports/project-1-level3-summary.md <<EOF
# Project 1 Level 3 Validation Summary

bash .codex/tasks/epic-learning-integration.md

# Verify learnings applied to Epic 2 PRPs
# Compare Epic 1 vs Epic 2 quality metrics
```

## Quick Reference

### Daily Operations

**When starting a new project:**
```bash
# 1. Create tracking file
PROJECT_NAME="new-project"
cp docs/validation/level-3-operational-testing-guide.md \
   .codex/state/phase2-validation/tracking/${PROJECT_NAME}.md

# 2. Enable execution learning
# (capture-execution-learnings.md automatically called by dev agent)

# 3. Use Phase 2 features naturally
# - *request-feedback when needed
# - Run prp-validation-enforcement before execution
# - Let failure-escalation handle issues
```

**When encountering ambiguity in architecture:**
```bash
# Architect agent:
*request-feedback pm "Story X.Y unclear: [specific issue]"

# PM agent (after receiving):
*update docs/prd.md  # Make clarification
*resolve-feedback fb-XXX "Clarified: [resolution]"
```

**Before starting PRP execution:**
```bash
# Dev agent should auto-run, but can manually trigger:
PRP_FILE="PRPs/epic-1-story-1.md"
bash .codex/tasks/prp-validation-enforcement.md

# Fix any issues, re-validate until score ≥ 90
```

**Between epics:**
```bash
# After Epic 1 complete, before Epic 2:
COMPLETED_EPIC=1
NEXT_EPIC=2
bash .codex/tasks/epic-learning-integration.md

# Review learning summary before creating Epic 2 PRPs
cat .codex/state/epic-learnings/epic-1-learning-summary.md
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Feedback request not tracked

**Symptom:** *request-feedback command executed but workflow.json not updated

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check workflow.json has feedback_requests field
grep -q "feedback_requests" .codex/state/workflow.json || {
    echo "Adding feedback_requests field..."
    jq '. + {feedback_requests: []}' .codex/state/workflow.json > /tmp/wf.json
    mv /tmp/wf.json .codex/state/workflow.json
}
```

---

### Issue: PRP validation failing with "command not found"

**Symptom:** Validation enforcement exits with bash errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Ensure validation script is executable
chmod +x .codex/tasks/prp-validation-enforcement.md

# Or run with bash explicitly
bash .codex/tasks/prp-validation-enforcement.md
```

---

### Issue: Epic learning integration finds no reports

**Symptom:** "No execution reports found for Epic X"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check execution reports exist
ls -la .codex/state/execution-reports/epic-1-*.json

# If missing, ensure capture-execution-learnings ran during implementation
# Reports should be created at: start, level_complete (×5), final
```
