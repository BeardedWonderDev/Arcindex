**Example Content:**
```markdown
## Frontend Architecture

### Component Architecture
The application follows atomic design principles with three component tiers:

**Atoms:** Basic UI elements (Button, Input, Icon)
**Molecules:** Simple component groups (FormField, SearchBar)
**Organisms:** Complex components (Header, ProductCard, CheckoutForm)
**Templates:** Page layouts (DashboardLayout, AuthLayout)
**Pages:** Route-specific implementations

**Component Organization:**
```
src/components/
├── atoms/
├── molecules/
├── organisms/
├── templates/
└── pages/
```

### State Management
**Global State:** Zustand store for authentication, user preferences, cart
**Server State:** React Query for API data caching and synchronization
**Local State:** useState for component-specific UI state

**State Shape:**
```typescript
interface AppState {
  auth: AuthState;
  cart: CartState;
  preferences: PreferencesState;
}
```
```

#### What CODEX Has

**Current Coverage:**
- General "Component Architecture" section
- No state management discussion
- No routing architecture
- No frontend service layer patterns
- Frontend concerns mixed with backend in single "Component Map"

#### Impact of Gap

**For Frontend Developers:**
- No clear component organization patterns
- No state management guidance (Redux vs Zustand vs Context)
- No routing structure standards
- No API integration layer patterns
- Inconsistent frontend architecture across features

**For AI Agents:**
- Cannot generate consistent component structures
- Don't know which state management to use
- No routing patterns to follow
- API integration approaches vary

**For Project Success:**
- Frontend technical debt accumulates

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid
We follow the testing pyramid with the following coverage targets:

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Unit Tests | 70%+ | Fast feedback, business logic validation |
| Integration Tests | 20%+ | Component interaction, API contracts |
| E2E Tests | 10%+ | Critical user flows, regression prevention |

### Frontend Test Organization

**Component Tests** (React Testing Library):
```
src/components/__tests__/
├── Button.test.tsx
├── FormField.test.tsx
└── ProductCard.test.tsx
```

**Testing Approach:**
- Test behavior, not implementation
- User-centric queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Mock external dependencies

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('ProductCard', () => {
  it('displays product information correctly', () => {
    const product = { id: 1, name: 'Widget', price: 9.99 };
    render(<ProductCard product={product} />);

    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Widget' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('$9.99')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Backend Test Organization

**Unit Tests:**
```
src/__tests__/unit/
├── services/
├── repositories/
└── utils/
```

**Integration Tests:**
```
src/__tests__/integration/
├── api/
├── database/
└── external-services/
```

### E2E Test Organization (Playwright)

**Critical Paths:**
```
e2e/
├── auth/
│   ├── login.spec.ts
│   └── registration.spec.ts
├── checkout/
│   └── purchase-flow.spec.ts
└── dashboard/
    └── user-dashboard.spec.ts
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on PR creation
- Run E2E tests before deployment
- Parallel test execution for speed
```

#### What CODEX Has

**Current Coverage:**
- No testing strategy section
- No test organization guidance
- No coverage targets
- No test examples
- Testing mentioned briefly in "Implementation Design" (if at all)

#### Impact of Gap

**For Development Teams:**
- No clear testing standards
- Inconsistent test coverage
- No guidance on what to test
- No test organization patterns
- Testing becomes afterthought

**For Quality:**
- Lower test coverage
- Bugs reach production
- Regression issues increase
- Difficult to refactor confidently

**For AI Agents:**
- Cannot write appropriate tests
- Don't know test framework to use
- No test organization patterns
- No coverage targets to aim for

#### Recommendation

**Add Section 5.5: Testing Strategy**

```yaml

## 5. Workflow & Process Gaps

### 5.1 Gap #4: Tech Stack "Single Source of Truth" Emphasis (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### What bmad-core Has

**Instruction in Template:**
```yaml
- id: tech-stack
  title: Tech Stack
  instruction: |
    This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection for the entire project.
    ALL development agents MUST use these exact versions. NO EXCEPTIONS.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Specify EXACT versions (e.g., "React 18.2.0", NOT "React 18.x" or "latest")
    - Document WHY each technology was chosen
    - List alternatives considered and why they were rejected
    - Get EXPLICIT user approval before proceeding
    - This section is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all technology decisions

    Every downstream agent will reference this section. Precision is critical.
  elicit: true
```

**Table Structure:**
- 18 categories (frontend language, backend language, database, cache, etc.)
- Columns: Category, Technology, **Exact Version**, Purpose, Rationale, Alternatives Considered
- Emphasis on "exact versions" throughout

#### What CODEX Has

**Instruction in Template:**
```yaml
- id: platform-selection
  title: Platform & Framework Selection
  instruction: |
    Define technology choices with rationale.
    Link each choice to specific requirements.
    Consider team expertise and ecosystem.
  elicit: true
```

**Table Structure:**
- Fewer categories (~8-10)
- Columns: Layer, Technology, Version, Rationale, Alternatives Considered
- Less emphasis on "definitive" nature

#### Impact

- Dev agents may deviate from specified versions
- "Latest" or version ranges may be used
- No clear single source of truth
- Technology choices may be questioned later

#### Recommendation

**Enhance Section 2 instruction:**
```yaml
- id: tech-stack
  title: Technology Stack
  instruction: |
    **THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY SELECTION FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT.**

    All development agents, PRP creators, and implementation teams MUST use
    these exact technologies and versions. This section is the SINGLE SOURCE
    OF TRUTH for all technology decisions.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Specify EXACT versions (e.g., "PostgreSQL 15.3", NOT "PostgreSQL 15.x" or "latest")
    2. Document rationale for each choice
    3. List alternatives considered and why rejected
    4. Verify compatibility between technologies
    5. Get explicit user approval before proceeding

    Categories to cover:
    - Frontend: Language, framework, UI library, state management
    - Backend: Language, framework, API style
    - Data: Database, cache, file storage, search
    - Auth: Authentication/authorization solution
    - Testing: Unit, integration, E2E frameworks
    - Build: Bundler, transpiler, IaC tool
    - DevOps: CI/CD, monitoring, logging
    - Cloud: Provider, key services

    Upon presenting the tech stack, explicitly state:
    "This is the definitive tech stack. All development must use these exact
    versions. Do you approve this as the single source of truth?"
  elicit: true
  elicitation_checkpoint: true
```

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes to enhance template

---

### 5.2 Gap #5: Platform Selection Decision Point (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### What bmad-core Has

**Explicit Section:** Platform Selection (before tech stack)

**Process:**
1. Analyze PRD requirements and technical assumptions
2. Present 2-3 platform options with detailed pros/cons
3. Make clear recommendation with rationale
4. Get explicit user confirmation
5. Document decision

**Example Options:**
- **Vercel + Supabase**: Rapid development, built-in auth/storage, serverless
- **AWS Full Stack**: Enterprise scale, full control, Lambda + API Gateway + RDS
- **Azure**: .NET ecosystems, enterprise Microsoft integration
- **Google Cloud**: ML/AI heavy workloads, Google ecosystem integration

**Elicitation:** Required at this step

#### What CODEX Has

**Current Approach:**
- Platform mentioned in tech stack table as one line item
- No dedicated decision-making process
- No explicit platform comparison
- Platform choice implied by framework selection

#### Impact

- Platform choice not explicitly validated
- Pros/cons of platforms not documented
- May choose framework that doesn't fit platform well
- Infrastructure assumptions unclear

#### Recommendation

**Add Section 2.1: Platform Selection Decision**

```yaml
- id: platform-selection
  title: Platform Selection Decision
  instruction: |
    Make explicit platform selection before choosing specific technologies.

    Process:
    1. Review PRD requirements (scale, features, timeline)
    2. Present 2-3 viable platform options
    3. Compare pros/cons for THIS project
    4. Make recommendation with clear rationale
    5. Get explicit user approval

    Common options to consider:
    - **Vercel + Supabase/Firebase**: JAMstack, rapid dev, built-in backend
    - **AWS**: Full control, enterprise scale, broad services
    - **Azure**: Microsoft ecosystem, .NET friendly, enterprise
    - **Google Cloud**: ML/AI capabilities, Google services
    - **Cloudflare**: Edge computing, global distribution, serverless
    - **Self-hosted**: Full control, specific requirements

    Decision factors:
    - Scalability requirements
    - Development speed priority
    - Team expertise
    - Budget constraints
    - Compliance requirements
    - Vendor lock-in tolerance
  elicit: true
  elicitation_checkpoint: true
  sections:
    - id: platform-options
      title: Platform Options Analysis
      type: table
      columns: [Platform, Pros, Cons, Fit for Project, Estimated Cost]

    - id: platform-recommendation
      title: Platform Recommendation
      type: structured
      components:
        - Recommended platform
        - Key reasons for selection
        - Concerns or trade-offs
        - Alternative if primary unavailable
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour to add section
