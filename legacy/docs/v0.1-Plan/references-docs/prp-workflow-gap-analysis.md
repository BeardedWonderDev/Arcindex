# CODEX PRP Workflow Gap Analysis
**Generated:** 2025-10-07
**Analysis Type:** Comprehensive workflow review of PRP creation and execution systems

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the CODEX PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) creation and execution workflow by reviewing:
- `/prp-create` and `/prp-execute` slash commands
- `prp-creator` and `dev` codex agents
- PRP document structure and examples
- Integration points and workflow continuity

**Overall Assessment:** The CODEX PRP system is conceptually excellent with strong foundations in zero-knowledge handoff design, progressive validation, and pattern-following philosophy. However, **17 critical gaps** exist between specification and execution that impact workflow reliability and one-pass implementation success rates.

**Risk Level Distribution:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks Success): 5 gaps
- 🟡 HIGH (Degrades Experience): 7 gaps
- 🟢 MEDIUM (Improvement Opportunity): 5 gaps

---

## Gap Category 1: Workflow Continuity and Integration

### 🔴 GAP 1.1: No Pre-Flight PRP Validation in Execution Flow

**Location:** `/prp-execute` command, `dev` agent activation

**Issue:**
- `/prp-execute` begins implementation immediately without validating PRP quality
- `dev` agent assumes PRP passes "No Prior Knowledge" test
- No automated call to PRP quality validation before execution starts

**Evidence from Analysis:**
- `prp-execute.md` (Line ~30): "Read entire PRP file, absorb all sections..."
- No mention of quality gate verification
- `dev` agent documentation: "Assumes high-quality PRP input; lacks pre-flight validation"

**Impact:**
- Poor quality PRPs cause execution failures
- Late-stage failures after significant implementation work
- Wasted context window on unvalidatable PRPs
- No early warning of missing dependencies or broken references

**Current Workaround:** Manual `/validate-prp` command (not enforced)

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
# Add to /prp-execute Phase 0: Pre-Flight Validation
Phase 0: Pre-Flight Validation (MANDATORY)
  - Run PRP quality check using .codex/tasks/prp-quality-check.md
  - Verify all file references exist at specified paths
  - Validate all URLs are accessible
  - Check validation commands are executable
  - Score must be ≥90/100 to proceed
  - HALT if validation fails, provide specific remediation steps
```

### 🟡 GAP 1.2: Inconsistent TodoWrite Usage Between Creation and Execution

**Location:** `/prp-create` (Line ~192), `/prp-execute` (Phase 2), `prp-creator` agent (Lines 192-208), `dev` agent

**Issue:**
- Both systems use TodoWrite for ULTRATHINK planning
- **prp-create**: TodoWrite happens AFTER research, BEFORE writing PRP
- **prp-execute**: TodoWrite happens AFTER PRP load, BEFORE implementation
- **Timing inconsistency:** Create-side TodoWrite doesn't inform execution-side TodoWrite

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# prp-create timing:
Research → ULTRATHINK (TodoWrite) → Write PRP

# prp-execute timing:
Load PRP → ULTRATHINK (TodoWrite) → Implement

# Gap: The TodoWrite plans are disconnected
```

**Impact:**
- Research insights from creation phase lost
- Execution phase must re-discover implementation strategy
- Redundant planning effort
- Potential misalignment between creator's intent and executor's interpretation

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
# Add to PRP template:
## Implementation Planning Context
### Creator's TodoWrite Plan
```yaml
original_tasks:
  - Research finding: Pattern X found in file Y
  - Validation strategy: Use commands A, B, C
  - Known blockers: Issue Z requires workaround W
```

This preserves creator's implementation strategy for executor.
```

---

### 🔴 GAP 1.3: Archon MCP Integration Completely Missing

**Location:** Global CLAUDE.md, all slash commands, all agents

**Issue:**
- CLAUDE.md Line 6-11: **"CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE"** mandates Archon MCP as PRIMARY task system
- Neither `/prp-create` nor `/prp-execute` check or use Archon MCP
- Neither `prp-creator` nor `dev` agents integrate with Archon MCP
- TodoWrite is used instead, violating stated policy
- **Fundamental architectural conflict**

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# From CLAUDE.md:
"VIOLATION CHECK: If you used TodoWrite first, you violated this rule."

# Current Reality:
- /prp-create: Uses TodoWrite only
- /prp-execute: Uses TodoWrite only
- prp-creator: Uses TodoWrite only
- dev: Uses TodoWrite only

# Archon mentions: ZERO
```

**Impact:**
- Policy violation on every PRP workflow execution
- No integration with Archon's project/task/document management
- No knowledge base integration (RAG search unused)
- No task status persistence in Archon system
- Disconnected from user's stated task management preference

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
# Phase 0 for ALL workflows:
1. Check Archon MCP availability: mcp__archon__health_check
2. Create/find project in Archon: mcp__archon__find_projects
3. Create task for PRP work: mcp__archon__manage_task
4. Use TodoWrite as SECONDARY local tracking
5. Update Archon task status as work progresses
6. Mark Archon task "review" when complete
```

---

### 🟡 GAP 1.4: State Persistence Inconsistency

**Location:** `/prp-create`, `/prp-execute`, `.codex/state/` directory

**Issue:**
- `dev` agent writes extensive state to `.codex/state/` (validation results, coverage reports)
- `/prp-create` has no state persistence mechanism
- Long research phases can be lost if interrupted
- No checkpoint/resume capability for PRP creation

**Evidence:**
```bash
# dev agent state artifacts:
.codex/state/level-1-validation.json
.codex/state/swiftlint-results.json
.codex/state/coverage-report.json
.codex/state/validation-results.json

# prp-create state artifacts:
[NONE FOUND]
```

**Impact:**
- PRP creation must restart from scratch if interrupted
- Research findings lost if context overflow occurs
- No ability to resume partially completed PRP
- Asymmetric workflow robustness (execution has checkpoints, creation doesn't)

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
# Add to /prp-create:
State Management:
  checkpoint_file: ".codex/state/prp-creation-{feature-name}.json"
  saved_state:
    - research_phase_completed: true
    - codebase_findings: [...]
    - external_research_urls: [...]
    - validation_commands_verified: [...]
    - ultrathink_todos: [...]
  resume_capability: true
```

---

## Gap Category 2: Validation and Quality Assurance

### 🔴 GAP 2.1: Validation Command Verification Not Enforced in Creation

**Location:** `prp-creator` agent (Lines 146-178), actual PRP examples

**Issue:**
- `prp-creator` instructions: **"CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: VERIFY validation commands work before including in PRP"**
- Verification process detailed across 4 levels
- **Reality:** Examined PRPs contain validation commands WITHOUT evidence of verification
- No enforcement mechanism for verification requirement

**Evidence from `bmad-elicitation-implementation.md`:**
```bash
# Level 1: Syntax & Style
ruff check .codex/ --fix
ruff format .codex/

# Level 2: Unit Tests
uv run pytest .codex/tests/ -v

# ⚠️ No evidence these commands were tested during PRP creation
# ⚠️ No expected output documented
# ⚠️ No failure scenarios provided
```

**Impact:**
- PRPs may contain non-functional validation commands
- Execution fails at validation stage with unclear errors
- "Verify first" instruction ignored without consequence
- Breaks one-pass implementation guarantee

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
# Mandatory verification log in PRP:
## Validation Command Verification Log

### Level 1 Verification
command: "ruff check .codex/ --fix"
tested_at: "2025-10-07T14:30:00Z"
result: "SUCCESS"
output: "All checks passed. 0 errors found."
notes: "Command works in project root directory"

### Level 2 Verification
command: "uv run pytest .codex/tests/ -v"
tested_at: "2025-10-07T14:35:00Z"
result: "SUCCESS"
output: "27 passed in 3.2s"
coverage: "87%"
notes: "Requires uv tool installed"
```

---

### 🟡 GAP 2.2: No Automated Context Completeness Scoring

**Location:** PRP template "Context Completeness Check" section, `prp-quality-check.md`

**Issue:**
- PRPs include manual "No Prior Knowledge" test
- Scoring is subjective (creator self-assesses)
- No automated metrics for context completeness
- Quality check task provides scoring rubric but no automation

**Current Process:**
```markdown
### Context Completeness Check
_"If someone knew nothing about this codebase, would they have everything needed?"_

☐ Passes "No Prior Knowledge" test
☐ All references specific and accessible
☐ Tasks include exact guidance
☐ Validation commands verified
```

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent quality assessment
- Over-optimistic confidence scores
- Missing context discovered during execution (too late)
- No objective benchmark for improvement

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
# Automated context scoring algorithm:
def score_context_completeness(prp: PRP) -> ContextScore:
    score = 0

    # File references (20 points)
    file_refs = prp.extract_file_references()
    for ref in file_refs:
        if ref.has_line_numbers: score += 2
        if ref.has_pattern_description: score += 2
        if ref.file_exists(): score += 1

    # URL references (15 points)
    urls = prp.extract_urls()
    for url in urls:
        if url.has_section_anchor: score += 3
        if url.is_accessible(): score += 2

    # Validation commands (20 points)
    commands = prp.extract_validation_commands()
    for cmd in commands:
        if cmd.has_expected_output: score += 4
        if cmd.verified_working: score += 6

    # Task specificity (25 points)
    tasks = prp.extract_implementation_tasks()
    for task in tasks:
        if task.has_action_verb: score += 2
        if task.has_file_path: score += 2
        if task.has_pattern_reference: score += 3
        if task.has_naming_convention: score += 2

    # Gotchas (10 points)
    gotchas = prp.extract_gotchas()
    score += min(len(gotchas) * 2, 10)

    # Dependency ordering (10 points)
    if prp.tasks_have_dependency_order(): score += 10

    return ContextScore(
        total=score,
        max=100,
        grade="A+" if score >= 95 else "A" if score >= 90 else "B+",
        pass_threshold=90
    )
```

---

### 🟡 GAP 2.3: Progressive Validation Enforcement Ambiguity

**Location:** `/prp-execute` validation protocol, `dev` agent validation system

**Issue:**
- Documentation states: "Each level MUST pass before proceeding to next"
- **Enforcement mechanism unclear:**
  - Is this programmatically enforced?
  - Or natural language instruction agents must follow?
- No visible hard-stop mechanism in code

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# From dev agent analysis:
"failure_protocol:
  when_validation_fails:
    - action: 'HALT workflow immediately'
    - retry_protocol: 'Fix issues and re-run until passing'
    - no_skip: 'Cannot proceed with failures'"

# But enforcement is instructional, not programmatic
```

**Impact:**
- Agents may proceed despite validation failures (if they interpret instructions loosely)
- No automated gating between levels
- Quality degradation if enforcement not strictly followed

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
# Programmatic validation gate:
class ValidationGate:
    def __init__(self, prp: PRP):
        self.prp = prp
        self.results = {}

    def run_level(self, level: int) -> ValidationResult:
        if level > 1 and not self.results.get(level - 1, {}).get("passed"):
            raise ValidationGateError(
                f"Cannot run Level {level}: Level {level-1} has not passed"
            )

        result = self._execute_level_commands(level)
        self.results[level] = result

        if not result["passed"]:
            raise ValidationGateError(
                f"Level {level} failed. Must fix before proceeding.",
                details=result["failures"]
            )

        return result
```

---

### 🟢 GAP 2.4: Anti-Pattern Detection Not Automated

**Location:** PRP "Anti-Patterns to Avoid" section, validation levels 1.5 and 2.5

**Issue:**
- PRPs list anti-patterns manually
- Detection relies on manual code review
- Validation Level 1.5 and 2.5 check for placeholders/stubs but not comprehensively

**Current Anti-Pattern Detection:**
```yaml
Level 1.5: Placeholder Detection
  patterns: ["TODO", "FIXME", "XXX", "HACK"]

Level 2.5: Stub Detection
  patterns: ["fatalError", "NotImplementedError"]
```

**Missing:**
- Generic "Follow existing patterns" without file reference
- "Implement as needed" without requirements
- Empty error handlers (`except: pass`)
- Hardcoded credentials
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
# Comprehensive anti-pattern scanner:
ANTI_PATTERNS = {
    "placeholder_code": [
        r"TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK",
        r"placeholder|stub|not implemented",
        r"coming soon|temporarily"
    ],
    "incomplete_implementation": [
        r"fatalError\(",
        r"raise NotImplementedError",
        r"pass\s*$",  # Empty function bodies
        r"return None\s*$"  # Functions that just return None
    ],
    "security_issues": [
        r"eval\(",  # Arbitrary code execution
        r"exec\(",
        r"password\s*=\s*[\"'][^\"']+[\"']",  # Hardcoded passwords
        r"api_key\s*=\s*[\"'][^\"']+[\"']",
        r"\.format\(",  # SQL injection risk in queries
        r"cursor\.execute\(.+%s.+%",  # String formatting in SQL
    ],
    "bad_error_handling": [
        r"except:\s*pass",  # Swallowed exceptions
        r"except Exception:\s*pass",
        r"catch\s*{\s*}",  # Empty catch blocks
    ],
    "vague_references": [
        r"Follow existing patterns",  # Without file reference
        r"implement as needed",  # Without specification
        r"similar to",  # Without file path
    ]
}

def scan_for_anti_patterns(code: str, language: str) -> List[AntiPattern]:
    violations = []
    for category, patterns in ANTI_PATTERNS.items():
        for pattern in patterns:
            matches = re.finditer(pattern, code, re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE)
            for match in matches:
                violations.append(AntiPattern(
                    category=category,
                    pattern=pattern,
                    location=match.span(),
                    severity="CRITICAL" if category == "security_issues" else "HIGH"
                ))
    return violations
```

---

## Gap Category 3: Research and Context Synthesis

### 🟡 GAP 3.1: Research Depth Unbounded in Creation Phase

**Location:** `/prp-create` (Line ~115), `prp-creator` agent research process

**Issue:**
- Philosophy: **"Optimize for chance of success, not for speed"**
- No termination criteria for research phase
- No budget management (time, token count, number of searches)
- Could result in infinite research loop

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# Current instruction:
"Deep research with batch tools and parallel subagent execution"

# Missing:
- Max research time
- Max external fetches
- Max codebase searches
- Research completion criteria
```

**Impact:**
- PRP creation could take hours or never complete
- Context window exhaustion from excessive research
- Diminishing returns on additional research
- No clear "good enough" threshold

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Research Budget:
  max_duration: 30 minutes
  max_external_fetches: 20 URLs
  max_codebase_searches: 15 patterns
  max_parallel_agents: 5
  completion_criteria:
    - Found at least 3 implementation examples
    - Verified all validation commands work
    - Identified gotchas for main libraries
    - Found similar existing patterns in codebase

  research_phases:
    phase_1_quick_scan: 5 minutes
      - Goal: Find main patterns and docs
      - Budget: 5 fetches, 5 searches
    phase_2_deep_dive: 15 minutes
      - Goal: Verify patterns, test commands
      - Budget: 10 fetches, 7 searches
    phase_3_gap_filling: 10 minutes
      - Goal: Address any remaining unknowns
      - Budget: 5 fetches, 3 searches
```

---

### 🟡 GAP 3.2: External Research Quality Not Validated

**Location:** `/prp-create` external research section, `prp-creator` agent (Lines 128-140)

**Issue:**
- Instructions: "Search for library documentation with specific URLs"
- **No validation that found URLs are:**
  - Current (not outdated documentation)
  - Relevant (actually addresses the need)
  - Accessible (not behind paywalls or broken links)
  - Accurate (not community blogs with wrong info)

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# Current process:
1. Search for documentation
2. Add URLs to PRP
3. [No URL quality validation]

# Missing quality checks:
- URL accessibility verification
- Documentation version verification
- Source authority assessment (official docs > Stack Overflow > blog)
```

**Impact:**
- PRPs reference broken links
- Outdated documentation patterns used
- Execution fails when following bad references
- No confidence in external research quality

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
# URL quality validator:
class URLQualityValidator:
    TRUSTED_DOMAINS = [
        "docs.python.org",
        "docs.swift.org",
        "developer.apple.com",
        "github.com/[official-repos]"
    ]

    def validate_url(self, url: str) -> URLQuality:
        quality = URLQuality()

        # Accessibility check
        try:
            response = requests.head(url, timeout=5)
            quality.accessible = response.status_code == 200
        except:
            quality.accessible = False

        # Authority check
        domain = extract_domain(url)
        quality.authority = (
            "official" if domain in self.TRUSTED_DOMAINS
            else "community" if "stackoverflow.com" in domain
            else "blog" if any(blog in domain for blog in ["medium.com", "dev.to"])
            else "unknown"
        )

        # Freshness check (from HTML meta tags)
        if quality.accessible:
            page = requests.get(url)
            last_updated = extract_last_updated(page.content)
            quality.age_days = (datetime.now() - last_updated).days
            quality.fresh = quality.age_days < 365

        # Section anchor check
        quality.has_anchor = "#" in url

        return quality

# Use in PRP creation:
for url in research_urls:
    quality = validator.validate_url(url)
    if not quality.accessible:
        logger.warning(f"Inaccessible URL: {url}")
    if quality.authority not in ["official", "community"]:
        logger.warning(f"Low-authority source: {url}")
    if not quality.fresh:
        logger.warning(f"Potentially outdated: {url} (last updated {quality.age_days} days ago)")
```

---

### 🟢 GAP 3.3: No Pattern Verification Library

**Location:** Pattern verification phase in execution, pattern following in implementation

**Issue:**
- Every execution must verify patterns individually
- No shared library of verified patterns
- Repeated verification of common patterns across multiple PRPs
- No learning from past verifications

**Opportunity:**
```yaml
# Create pattern library:
patterns/
  authentication/
    jwt_auth_pattern.yaml:
      source_file: "src/services/UserService.swift"
      lines: "45-120"
      description: "Service structure with async/await and error handling"
      verified: true
      last_verified: "2025-10-01"
      used_in_prps: ["auth-enhancement", "user-management"]

  data_models/
    pydantic_model_pattern.yaml:
      source_file: "src/models/existing_model.py"
      description: "Pydantic model with field validation"
      pattern_snippet: |
        class ModelName(BaseModel):
            field: str = Field(..., description="")

            @validator('field')
            def validate_field(cls, v):
                return v
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster pattern verification
- Consistent pattern application across features
- Pattern evolution tracking
- Reduced research time

---

## Gap Category 4: Error Handling and Recovery

### 🔴 GAP 4.1: No Failure Escalation Protocol

**Location:** `/prp-execute` error handling, `dev` agent blocker management

**Issue:**
- Validation failures: "Fix issues and re-run until passing"
- **No limit on retry attempts**
- **No escalation path if repeated failures**
- Could result in infinite failure-fix-retry loop

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# Current protocol:
When validation fails:
  1. Analyze error
  2. Fix issues
  3. Re-run validation
  4. [Repeat indefinitely]

# Missing:
- Max retry count
- Escalation criteria
- User intervention trigger
- Failure pattern detection
```

**Impact:**
- Context window exhaustion from retry loops
- No recognition of fundamental PRP flaws
- No user awareness of stuck workflows
- Wasted time on unrecoverable failures

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Failure Escalation Protocol:

Level 1: Automatic Retry (0-3 failures)
  - Attempt automatic fix using PRP patterns
  - Consult gotchas section
  - Re-run validation

Level 2: Pattern Analysis (4-6 failures)
  - Analyze failure patterns
  - Check if same error recurring
  - If same error 3+ times → ESCALATE

Level 3: User Intervention (7+ failures OR same error 3x)
  - HALT workflow
  - Create detailed failure report:
      * What validation level failed
      * Error messages and logs
      * Fixes attempted (list all)
      * Suspected root cause
      * PRP quality assessment
  - Request user guidance:
      * Is PRP incomplete?
      * Are validation commands incorrect?
      * Should workflow be aborted?
  - AWAIT user decision before continuing

Level 4: Abort and Checkpoint (User decision)
  - Save current progress
  - Document blockers
  - Create recovery plan for manual completion
```

---

### 🟡 GAP 4.2: No Rollback Mechanism

**Location:** Progressive validation failure handling

**Issue:**
- Implementation proceeds through multiple files
- Validation failure discovered at Level 3 or 4
- **No automated way to undo partial implementation**
- Manual cleanup required

**Example Scenario:**
```yaml
Timeline:
  00:00 - Create Model files (pass Level 1, Level 2)
  00:15 - Create Service files (pass Level 1, Level 2)
  00:30 - Create API routes (pass Level 1, Level 2)
  00:45 - Run Level 3 Integration tests → FAIL

Problem:
  - Integration failure reveals fundamental design flaw
  - 15 files created and modified
  - No easy rollback to pre-implementation state
  - Manual cleanup required
```

**Impact:**
- Risk-averse implementations (avoid bold changes)
- Manual cleanup tedious and error-prone
- Partially implemented features pollute codebase

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Checkpoint System:

Pre-Implementation:
  - Create git stash or branch: "codex/prp-{feature-name}"
  - Document baseline state: list all existing files
  - Record git commit hash

During Implementation:
  - After each validation level passes → checkpoint
  - checkpoint_1: Level 1 passed (syntax clean)
  - checkpoint_2: Level 2 passed (unit tests pass)
  - checkpoint_3: Level 3 passed (integration works)

On Failure:
  - Offer rollback options:
    1. Rollback to last checkpoint
    2. Rollback to pre-implementation (start over)
    3. Continue with manual fixes (no rollback)

Rollback Execution:
  - If git enabled:
    git reset --hard {checkpoint_commit_hash}
  - If git disabled:
    rm {list of created files}
    git restore {list of modified files}
```

---

### 🟢 GAP 4.3: Context Overflow Protection Insufficient

**Location:** `dev` agent context management (Lines mention 35k/40k/44k token thresholds)

**Issue:**
- Thresholds defined but **response unclear**
- "Create emergency checkpoint" — how?
- "Preserve essential context" — what's essential?
- No automated handoff procedure

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Context Overflow Protection:

Warning Level (35,000 tokens):
  - ACTION: Compress TodoWrite list (completed tasks → summary)
  - ACTION: Remove verbose validation logs (keep only pass/fail status)
  - MESSAGE: "Context approaching limit. Compression applied."

Critical Level (40,000 tokens):
  - ACTION: Create emergency checkpoint file
    Location: .codex/state/emergency-checkpoint-{feature}.md
    Contents:
      - Current progress summary
      - Completed todos (condensed)
      - Remaining todos (detailed)
      - Validation status
      - Known blockers
      - Files created/modified
  - ACTION: Aggressive context pruning
  - MESSAGE: "Context critical. Emergency checkpoint created."

Emergency Level (44,000 tokens):
  - ACTION: HALT workflow immediately
  - ACTION: Finalize checkpoint document
  - ACTION: Add "How to Resume" instructions:
      1. Read emergency checkpoint file
      2. Review validation status
      3. Continue from checkpoint state
  - MESSAGE: "Context overflow imminent. Workflow halted. Resume with: /prp-execute-resume {checkpoint_file}"

  # Create /prp-execute-resume command:
  /prp-execute-resume {checkpoint_file}:
    - Load checkpoint state
    - Reconstruct TodoWrite list
    - Resume from last incomplete task
```

## Gap Category 5: Tool Usage and Coordination

### 🟡 GAP 5.1: Batch Tool / Task Tool Ambiguity

**Location:** `/prp-create` (Line ~120, 130), `prp-creator` agent

**Issue:**
- Instructions: "Use the batch tools to spawn subagents"
- **"Batch tools" is vague and undefined**
- Appears to reference Claude Code's `Task` tool but not explicit
- No error handling for failed subagent spawns
- No max parallel agent limit specified

**Evidence:**
```yaml
# Instruction says:
"Spawn parallel subagents using Task tool"

# But doesn't specify:
- How many agents can be spawned simultaneously
- What to do if Task tool fails
- How to aggregate results from parallel agents
- How to handle agent failures or timeouts
```

**Impact:**
- Implementers may not know how to spawn subagents
- Risk of spawning excessive agents (resource exhaustion)
- No failure recovery if agent spawning fails

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Subagent Coordination Protocol:

Tool: Task (Claude Code Task tool)

Limits:
  max_parallel_agents: 5
  agent_timeout: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

Usage Pattern:
  # Spawn parallel codebase analysis agents:
  agents = []
  for search_pattern in ["auth patterns", "service patterns", "test patterns"]:
      agent = Task(
          subagent_type="general-purpose",
          description=f"Search for {search_pattern}",
          prompt=f"Use Grep and Glob to find {search_pattern}. Report findings.",
          timeout=600
      )
      agents.append(agent)

  # Aggregate results:
  results = await asyncio.gather(*[agent.run() for agent in agents])

  # Handle failures:
  for result in results:
      if result.status == "failed":
          logger.error(f"Agent failed: {result.error}")
          # Fallback: Run search sequentially
```

### 🟢 GAP 5.2: Read Tool Pattern Verification Not Standardized

**Location:** Pattern verification phase in execution

**Issue:**
- Instruction: "Read actual files referenced in PRP, verify patterns exist"
- **No standardized Read protocol**
- Unclear what "verify pattern exists" means specifically

**Example ambiguity:**
```yaml
# PRP says:
FOLLOW pattern: src/services/UserService.swift:45-120 (service structure)

# Agent should:
- Read src/services/UserService.swift lines 45-120
- Confirm what specifically?
  * Class structure?
  * Method signatures?
  * Error handling approach?
  * Naming conventions?
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Pattern Verification Protocol:

For each pattern reference in PRP:

1. Parse Pattern Reference:
   file: "src/services/UserService.swift"
   lines: "45-120"
   pattern_type: "service structure"

2. Read File with Read Tool:
   Read(file_path="src/services/UserService.swift", offset=45, limit=75)

3. Extract Pattern Elements:
   - Class name and structure
   - Method signatures (parameters, return types)
   - Error handling pattern (try/catch, Result type, etc.)
   - Async patterns (async/await, completion handlers)
   - Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case)
   - Import statements

4. Document Pattern:
   pattern_doc = {
       "class_structure": "class UserService { ... }",
       "method_pattern": "async func methodName(param: Type) throws -> ReturnType",
       "error_handling": "try await with do/catch",
       "naming": "camelCase for methods",
       "imports": ["Foundation", "Combine"]
   }

5. Use Pattern in Implementation:
   Apply documented pattern elements to new implementation
```

## Gap Category 6: Documentation and Knowledge Management

### 🟢 GAP 6.1: No PRP Version Management

**Location:** PRP files in `PRPs/` directory

**Issue:**
- PRPs are created as single files
- No version tracking
- No update mechanism
- No history of changes

**Current State:**
```
PRPs/
  feature-auth.md          # Created 2025-09-01
  feature-payments.md      # Created 2025-09-15

# If requirements change:
- Must create new PRP or manually edit existing
- No diff view of what changed
- No understanding of PRP evolution
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
PRP Versioning System:

PRPs/
  feature-auth/
    v1.0.md           # Initial PRP
    v1.1.md           # Updated after implementation feedback
    v2.0.md           # Major requirements change
    changelog.md      # What changed between versions
    metadata.yaml:
      current_version: "2.0"
      created: "2025-09-01"
      last_updated: "2025-10-05"
      implementations:
        - version: "1.0"
          executed: "2025-09-03"
          success: true
          notes: "Minor validation issues but completed"
        - version: "2.0"
          executed: "2025-10-07"
          status: "in_progress"

# Metadata schema:
prp_version: "2.0"
parent_version: "1.0"  # If updated from previous
status: "draft|validated|executing|completed|deprecated"
success_rate: 100  # Percentage (if executed)
average_implementation_time: "4 hours"  # If executed
common_blockers: ["Missing dependency X", "Ambiguous requirement Y"]
```

### 🔴 GAP 6.2: No Feedback Loop from Execution to Creation

**Location:** Entire PRP workflow

**Issue:**
- PRP created with research and planning
- PRP executed, may encounter issues
- **No mechanism to feed execution learnings back to improve PRP quality**
- **No way to update PRP based on implementation reality**

**Current Flow:**
```
Create PRP → Execute PRP → [Implementation complete]
                                     ↓
                            [Learnings lost]
```

**Impact:**
- Same mistakes repeated in future PRPs
- PRP creation doesn't improve over time
- No validation that PRPs enable one-pass success
- Confidence scores never validated against reality

**Recommended Fix:**
```yaml
Feedback Loop System:

Phase 1: During Execution (Capture Issues)
  Create: .codex/state/prp-execution-report-{feature}.json
  Contents:
    prp_file: "PRPs/feature-auth.md"
    execution_start: "2025-10-07T10:00:00Z"
    execution_end: "2025-10-07T14:30:00Z"
    duration_hours: 4.5

    validation_results:
      level_1: {passed: true, attempts: 1}
      level_2: {passed: true, attempts: 2, issues: ["Test fixture missing"]}
      level_3: {passed: true, attempts: 1}
      level_4: {passed: true, attempts: 1}

    prp_quality_issues:
      - type: "missing_pattern"
        description: "PRP referenced AuthService.swift:120-150 but that was actually AuthManager.swift"
        impact: "10 minutes lost verifying correct file"

      - type: "validation_command_incorrect"
        description: "PRP said 'pytest tests/' but should be 'uv run pytest tests/'"
        impact: "Command failed, had to debug"

      - type: "gotcha_missing"
        description: "Didn't warn about async/await requirement in database layer"
        impact: "Had to refactor after Level 2 failures"

    what_worked_well:
      - "Dependency ordering in tasks was perfect"
      - "External documentation URLs were all accessible and helpful"
      - "Anti-patterns section prevented SQL injection vulnerability"

Phase 2: Post-Execution (Update PRP)
  Action: Create updated PRP version
  - Add newly discovered gotchas
  - Fix incorrect file references
  - Update validation commands
  - Adjust confidence score based on reality

Phase 3: Knowledge Base (Aggregate Learnings)
  Create: .codex/knowledge/prp-learnings.yaml
  Contents:
    common_prp_issues:
      - issue: "File references outdated"
        frequency: 15  # times encountered
        fix: "Verify file paths during PRP creation with Glob tool"

      - issue: "Validation commands missing tool prefix"
        frequency: 8
        fix: "Always test commands during PRP creation phase"

    pattern_library:
      - pattern: "JWT authentication service"
        source_prps: ["auth-v2", "user-management"]
        verified: true
        reusable: true
```

## Conclusion

The CODEX PRP system demonstrates sophisticated understanding of AI-assisted development workflows with strong conceptual foundations. However, the **17 identified gaps** create friction between ideal workflow and reality.

**Biggest Risk:** Gap 1.3 (Archon integration missing) represents a fundamental architectural violation of stated policies that undermines the entire task management strategy.

**Biggest Opportunity:** Gap 6.2 (feedback loop) would enable continuous improvement and validate that PRPs actually enable one-pass implementation success.

**Implementation Priority:** Address critical gaps first (especially pre-flight validation and failure escalation) to improve reliability, then tackle Archon integration to align with architectural principles, then enhance quality with automated scoring and validation.

With these gaps addressed, the CODEX PRP system would be a **best-in-class** implementation documentation system capable of reliably achieving one-pass implementation success rates above 90%.
