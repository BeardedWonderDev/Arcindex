### Changed

- Orchestrator architecture: Modularized orchestrator with protocol-based task delegation extracting command handling logic into 8 dedicated protocol tasks - Reduced orchestrator from 986 to 113 lines (88% reduction) with protocols for workflow-start, workflow-continue, workflow-status, agent-spawning, output-handling, anti-summarization, mode-display, and mode-switch - Follows "thin orchestrator, thick protocols" pattern for improved maintainability and reusability (9 files, 2289 insertions, 1419 deletions)
- Smart-commit sync strategy: Optimized sync logic moving from pre-commit to post-commit phase with safety checks - Detects unstaged changes before push, only syncs when working directory is clean, waits for in-progress workflows before pull/rebase, prevents push failures from workflow commit conflicts (1 file, 71 insertions, 57 deletions)
- NPX installer architecture: Migrated to pure ES modules and eliminated code duplication with thin CLI wrapper pattern - Fixed inquirer.prompt error through ES module conversion (6 .cjs→.js files), removed duplicate installCodex/updateCodex/showSuccessMessage functions (233 lines), corrected .claude directory copying (now only codex.md), fixed documentation files bug, improved success message with missing "claude" command step and correct workflow start command (10 files, 131 insertions, 338 deletions)
- Distribution strategy: Comprehensive research on distribution methods including package managers, binary downloads, Docker, Git templates, and multi-platform automation with strategic recommendation for hybrid approach (Template via npx + CLI via npm/Homebrew/Scoop) - Supports v0.1 release planning with detailed analysis of npm vs npx trade-offs, real-world case studies (GitHub CLI, Deno, Stripe CLI, Vercel), and GoReleaser automation guidance (4 files, 4980 insertions)
- Documentation structure: Reorganized with user guides moved to root level, .claude/ development references added, and docs/ research/testing directories created - Aligns with artifact policy where .codex/ is product code and detailed guides are artifacts (20 files, 10909 insertions)
- Test harness results storage: Moved from in-repo to external ../codex-tests/ directory - Prevents git pollution, enables branch isolation without conflicts, and simplifies test management (7 files, 767 insertions)
- Roadmap consolidation: Removed duplicate roadmap sections from CHANGELOG.md and README.md - Single source of truth in ROADMAP.md (2 files, 6 insertions, 86 deletions)
- GitHub Actions workflow routing: Updated Claude workflow to exclude @claude-artifacts mentions and grant write permissions - Routed to dedicated ai-artifact-cleanup workflow (2 files, 28 modifications)
- Changelog workflow prompt: Simplified from 180-line prescriptive prompt to 32-line goal-oriented approach - Replaces detailed bash commands with high-level tasks, giving Claude freedom to use Read/Grep/Edit or Bash, reducing turn usage and eliminating permission denial loops (1 file, 31 insertions, 130 deletions)
- Simplified architecture by removing Swift agent dependencies (feature-developer, syntax-reviewer, etc.)
- Replaced agent-based Level 4 validation with direct command execution (swiftlint, swift test, xcodebuild)
- Updated elicitation menu from confusing 0-8+9 format to intuitive 1-9 pattern with option 1 = "Proceed to next section"
- Enhanced orchestrator with pre-launch validation protocol requiring Level 0 checks before agent activation
- Improved workflow initialization UX by removing redundant "Proceed with discovery phase?" confirmation
- Enhanced PRP creator with ULTRATHINK planning phase and verification of validation commands
- Streamlined PRP creation by removing mandatory elicitation process for faster generation
- Modernized all workflow YAML files with standardized mode documentation
- Updated validation command execution mechanism for language-agnostic support
- Enhanced orchestrator to pass agent output verbatim (no reformatting or summarization)
- Improved create-doc task with full content presentation requirements

### Fixed

- Smart-commit push failures: Enhanced /smart-commit with pre-flight sync in Phase 0 that fetches remote, checks for workflow commits, monitors running workflows and waits for completion, then pulls and rebases workflow commits before proceeding - Prevents push failures when workflows from previous commits create additional commits that need synchronization (1 file, 45 insertions, 2 deletions)
- Orchestrator discovery flow and test script reliability: Enhanced discovery-phase-handling with multi-step agent pattern, enforced proper Task output display without summarizing, documented auto-progression vs HALT rules, and added self-check validation for discovery outputs - Also fixed test scripts with clean-tests.sh preserving directory structure and run-test.sh using proper mapfile alternative for branch array population (3 files, 134 insertions, 9 deletions)
- Architect agent silent file creation failure: Standardized template format from nested output.filename to flat output_file structure, added mandatory file operation enforcement to all document-creating agents (analyst, PM, architect), and clarified flat-structure-only requirement in create-doc.md - Prevents silent file creation failures across entire document workflow chain where operations would fail silently while workflow state was optimistically updated (7 files, 19 insertions, 15 deletions)
- Orchestrator content suppression: Fixed progressive bug where orchestrator stops displaying section content after analyst phase sections 3-4 - Added mode-aware output handling with anti-summarization protocol, VERBATIM display requirements, and BLOCKING HALT after elicitation menus (1 file, 165 insertions, 10 deletions)
- Broken file reference: Corrected prp-validation-enforcement.md references from non-existent .codex/data/prp-quality-checklist.md to correct .codex/checklists/prp-quality-gate.md - Task would fail if invoked with incorrect path (2 files, 26 insertions, 22 deletions)
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers: Replaced unsupported push event with schedule (daily) and workflow_dispatch (manual testing) triggers based on claude-code-action documentation - Resolves 'Unsupported event type: push' error (2 files, 10 insertions, 6 deletions)
- Workflow allowedTools configuration: Added Read, Edit, Write, and Bash tools (git, grep, awk, date, head, tail, wc, cut, echo) to enable file operations and git commands - Resolves permission denials that prevented Claude from executing workflow tasks (3 files, 3 insertions)
- Workflow max-turns limits: Increased from 15-20 to 30-40 turns to allow Claude enough time to complete complex changelog operations - Previous runs hit max-turns before completing (3 files, 6 insertions, 6 deletions)
- YAML syntax in GitHub Actions workflows: Fixed multi-line git commit message format using multiple -m flags instead of embedded newlines - Resolves "could not find expected ':' while scanning a simple key" parsing error (4 files, 11 insertions, 17 deletions)
- Backslash line continuations in workflow YAML prompts: Removed backslash continuations from bash commands inside YAML literal blocks - YAML interprets backslashes before bash sees them, causing parsing errors (4 files, 5 insertions, 11 deletions)
- Orchestrator auto-spawning next section without waiting for user input in interactive mode
- Project brief template elicit flags (sections 6-8 now require elicitation)
- Analyst agent bypassing elicitation in interactive mode (was using batch processing incorrectly)
- Redundant PROCEED/WAIT confirmation after discovery elicitation menu selection
- Multiple file creation instead of enforced single file output from templates
- Summary presentation instead of full content display in analyst outputs
- Orchestrator reformatting agent output instead of verbatim pass-through
- Workflow execution rule enforcement across analyst, PM, and architect agents
- Elicitation menu format violations (agents using option 0 or incorrect numbering)
- Mode detection and pattern selection in agent workflows
- Runtime state initialization during discovery phase (was missing mandatory checks)
- Validation gate enforcement to prevent phase transition without completed elicitation
- Workflow.json path references in state manager task
