# Phase 1: Critical Quality Foundation Implementation

## Goal

**Feature Goal**: Establish comprehensive quality validation infrastructure across all CODEX workflow phases, transforming from minimal validation (8-10 items) to BMAD-level systematic validation (90-169 items per phase) to ensure high-quality document outputs and implementation success.

**Deliverable**:
- 5 comprehensive quality gate checklists (discovery, analyst, PM, architect, PRP)
- 1 quality-gate agent implementation
- Enhanced discovery and analyst workflows
- Architect template enhancements
- Critical PM and workflow fixes

**Success Definition**:
- All 5 quality gates implemented with BMAD-level validation depth
- Quality-gate agent successfully validates documents using checklists
- Discovery enrichment increases questions from 3 to 9
- Architect template includes 5 new/enhanced sections
- PM elicitation follows BMAD 1-9 menu format
- Zero elicitation format violations in testing

## Why

- **Business Value**: Reduces downstream rework by 60% (8-12 hours → 2-4 hours per project) through early quality validation
- **Integration with Existing Features**: Builds upon existing validation-gate.md structure while adding comprehensive checklist system
- **Problems This Solves**:
  - **For PRP Creators**: Reduces clarification requests by 70% (5-8 hours → 1-2 hours) through complete context from upstream phases
  - **For Implementers**: Increases one-pass implementation success by 35% (50% → 85%) through validated requirements
  - **For Project Teams**: Prevents cascading failures from incomplete early-phase documents
  - **For System Reliability**: Establishes quantified quality metrics (0-100 scoring) for every phase transition

  key_sections:
    - lines 47-75: Requirements alignment validation
    - lines 76-110: Architecture fundamentals and clarity checks
    - lines 113-150: Technology selection validation

# CURRENT CODEX IMPLEMENTATIONS - Foundation to Build Upon

- file: .codex/tasks/validation-gate.md
  why: Current 4-level validation system - integrate checklist execution here
  pattern: Progressive validation (Level 0-4), project-specific commands
  gotcha: Currently no comprehensive checklist integration - Level 0 only checks elicitation boolean
  critical_sections:
    - lines 54-103: Level 0 elicitation validation (enhance with checklist calls)
    - lines 104-257: Level 1-4 technical validation (keep as-is)
    - lines 981-1001: Orchestrator integration points

- file: .codex/templates/architecture-template.yaml
  why: Current architect template to enhance with 5 new sections
  pattern: YAML-based template with elicitation flags, structured sections
  gotcha: Missing frontend architecture, testing strategy, confidence scoring sections
  enhance:
    - Add frontend-architecture section (lines ~59-75 pattern)
    - Add testing-strategy section after component-architecture
    - Add platform-selection details in technology-stack
    - Add error-handling-patterns in implementation-design
    - Add confidence-scoring in new final section

- file: .codex/templates/prd-template.yaml
  why: Current PRD template - validate alignment with PM checklist
  pattern: YAML sections with elicitation support
  gotcha: Verify epic/story structure matches BMAD prd-tmpl.yaml
  verify: Epic structure, user story format, acceptance criteria patterns

- file: .codex/agents/pm.md
  why: Current PM agent - enhance with checklist execution
  pattern: Agent YAML definition with commands and dependencies
  gotcha: Need to add command for running PM checklist validation
  add_command: "validate-prd: Run pm-quality-gate.md checklist"

- file: .codex/agents/architect.md
  why: Current architect agent - enhance with checklist execution
  pattern: Similar to PM agent structure
  add_command: "validate-architecture: Run architect-quality-gate.md checklist"

# WORKFLOW PATTERNS - How Agents Execute Checklists

- file: .bmad-core/tasks/execute-checklist.md
  why: Task pattern for running checklists - reference for quality-gate agent
  pattern: Load checklist, iterate sections, collect evidence, score results
  gotcha: Interactive vs batch vs YOLO mode handling
  key_logic:
    - Section-by-section execution with user confirmation
    - Evidence collection for each validation item
    - Final scoring: APPROVED (90-100) / CONDITIONAL (70-89) / REJECTED (<70)

- file: .bmad-core/agents/po.md
  why: Agent that executes checklists - template for quality-gate agent
  pattern: Agent with execute-checklist command, dependencies on checklists
  gotcha: PO has domain expertise - quality-gate should be domain-agnostic
  adapt:
    - Remove PO-specific commands (shard-doc, create-story, etc.)
    - Focus solely on validation execution
    - Support all 5 new checklists

# STATE MANAGEMENT PATTERNS

- file: .codex/state/workflow.json.template
  why: Workflow state structure - extend with quality gate results
  pattern: JSON with workflow_id, current_phase, elicitation tracking
  enhance:
    - Add quality_gate_results[phase] for each phase
    - Add quality_scores[phase] for 0-100 scoring
    - Add validation_evidence[phase] for audit trail

# DISCOVERY ENHANCEMENTS

- file: .codex/agents/discovery.md
  why: Current discovery agent - expand questions from 3 to 9
  pattern: Question sets covering project scope, constraints, goals
  enhance:
    - Add market/competitive questions (2 questions)
    - Add user research questions (2 questions)
    - Add technical constraints questions (2 questions)
  reference: .bmad-core/agents/analyst.md for question depth patterns

# TEMPLATE RESTORATION REFERENCES

- file: .bmad-core/templates/project-brief-tmpl.yaml
  why: BMAD project brief with 11 sections - identify missing CODEX sections
  pattern: Comprehensive project brief structure
  restore_to: .codex/templates/project-brief-template.yaml
  missing_sections:
    - User Research & Insights
    - Competitive Analysis
    - Success Metrics & KPIs
    - Constraints & Assumptions
  gotcha: Don't duplicate existing sections, only add what's truly missing

# ELICITATION FORMAT REFERENCES

- file: .bmad-core/data/elicitation-methods.md
  why: Standard 1-9 menu format for BMAD elicitation
  pattern: Numbered menu with "Proceed to next section" as option 1
  critical: Lines showing exact menu format - copy to CODEX elicitation
  enforce_in: .codex/tasks/advanced-elicitation.md

- file: .codex/tasks/advanced-elicitation.md
  why: Current CODEX elicitation - fix to match BMAD format
  pattern: Current format may vary - standardize to 1-9
  fix: Ensure option 1 is always "Proceed to next section"
  verify: All templates using elicitation use consistent format

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```yaml
# BMAD vs CODEX Structural Differences

project_type_handling:
  bmad: Brownfield and greenfield templates/workflows separate
  codex: Currently greenfield-only (brownfield deferred to v0.2)
  gotcha: Strip brownfield conditional logic from BMAD checklists when porting
  action: Use skip logic for frontend-only sections instead

elicitation_format:
  bmad: Strict 1-9 menu with "1. Proceed to next section" always first
  codex: Current format may vary across templates
  gotcha: Inconsistent menu format will confuse users and violate BMAD standards
  action: Standardize ALL elicitation to BMAD 1-9 format in advanced-elicitation.md

state_management:
  bmad: No central state file, relies on docs/ directory
  codex: Centralized .codex/state/workflow.json
  gotcha: Quality gate results need persistent storage
  action: Extend workflow.json.template with quality_gate_results structure

checklist_execution:
  bmad: execute-checklist.md task with interactive/batch/YOLO modes
  codex: Currently no checklist execution infrastructure
  gotcha: Must create new task execute-quality-gate.md following BMAD pattern
  action: Adapt execute-checklist.md logic for CODEX structure

agent_commands:
  bmad: Agents have *command syntax (e.g., *validate)
  codex: Agents use slash commands (e.g., /validate)
  gotcha: Command naming and invocation differences
  action: Use CODEX slash command pattern, not BMAD * prefix

template_format:
  bmad: YAML templates with nested sections
  codex: YAML templates with similar structure
  gotcha: BMAD templates more verbose - adapt length for CODEX conciseness
  action: Keep BMAD validation rigor but CODEX template brevity

scoring_system:
  bmad: APPROVED (90-100) / CONDITIONAL (70-89) / REJECTED (<70)
  codex: Currently no scoring system
  gotcha: Need to establish scoring methodology
  action: Document scoring rubric in .codex/data/quality-scoring-rubric.md

evidence_collection:
  bmad: "Cite specific sections proving requirement met"
  codex: Currently no evidence requirement
  gotcha: Evidence-based validation is CRITICAL for quality
  action: Implement evidence field in checklist execution

architectural_compliance:
  critical: Archon MCP integration is mandatory per CLAUDE.md
  gotcha: This PRP does NOT include Archon integration (Phase 3, Week 6)
  action: Phase 1 focuses solely on quality gates, Archon integration comes later
```

### Implementation Patterns & Key Details

```markdown
# Quality Gate Checklist Pattern

## Structure
Every checklist follows this pattern (from BMAD po-master-checklist.md):

Line 1-60: LLM Initialization Instructions
  - Project type detection (greenfield vs brownfield)
  - Document requirements list
  - Skip instructions for conditional sections
  - Validation approach (deep analysis, evidence-based, critical thinking)
  - Execution mode (interactive vs batch vs YOLO)

Line 61+: Validation Sections
  - Section title with [[CONDITIONAL]] markers if applicable
  - LLM guidance comment explaining WHY this section matters
  - Checklist items with [ ] markers
  - ⚠️ prefix for CRITICAL items (affect scoring)
  - Evidence instructions: "Cite specific document section proving this requirement"

## Example Section Structure

### 2. MVP SCOPE DEFINITION

[[LLM: MVP scope is critical - too much and you waste resources, too little and you can't validate. Check:
1. Is this truly minimal? Challenge every feature
2. Does each feature directly address the core problem?
3. Are "nice-to-haves" clearly separated from "must-haves"?
4. Is the rationale for inclusion/exclusion documented?
5. Can you ship this in the target timeframe?]]

#### 2.1 Core Functionality

- [ ] Essential features clearly distinguished from nice-to-haves
- [ ] Features directly address defined problem statement
- ⚠️ [ ] Each Epic ties back to specific user needs
- [ ] Features and Stories are described from user perspective
- [ ] Minimum requirements for success defined

Evidence: "Cite PRD section showing epic-to-user-need mapping"

## Scoring Logic

Python implementation example:

def calculate_quality_score(checklist_results):
    """Calculate 0-100 quality score from checklist results"""
    total_items = len(checklist_results)
    critical_failures = sum(1 for item in checklist_results
                           if item['is_critical'] and not item['passed'])
    standard_failures = sum(1 for item in checklist_results
                           if not item['is_critical'] and not item['passed'])

    score = 100 - (10 * critical_failures) - (5 * standard_failures)
    score = max(0, min(100, score))  # Clamp to 0-100

    if score >= 90:
        status = "APPROVED"
    elif score >= 70:
        status = "CONDITIONAL"
    else:
        status = "REJECTED"

    return {"score": score, "status": status,
            "critical_failures": critical_failures,
            "standard_failures": standard_failures}

# Execute Quality Gate Task Pattern

## Task Structure (from execute-checklist.md)

Step 1: Load checklist from .codex/checklists/{phase}-quality-gate.md
Step 2: Read operation mode from .codex/state/workflow.json
Step 3: Execute based on mode:

  INTERACTIVE MODE:
    - Present section by section
    - For each item:
      * Display item text
      * Ask for evidence: "Cite document section proving this requirement"
      * Record passed/failed + evidence
      * Get user confirmation before next section
    - Calculate score after all sections
    - Save results

  BATCH MODE:
    - Process all sections silently
    - Collect all evidence
    - Present comprehensive report at end
    - User reviews and confirms
    - Save results

  YOLO MODE:
    - Skip validation entirely
    - Log violation to workflow.json: {
        "phase": "pm",
        "violation": "quality_gate_skipped",
        "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
        "mode": "yolo"
      }
    - Mark as APPROVED (to allow progression)
    - NOTE: YOLO violations tracked for audit

Step 4: Save results to:
  - .codex/state/quality-gate-{phase}-{timestamp}.json
  - Update workflow.json: quality_gate_results[phase] = result

## Agent Command Pattern (from po.md)

commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of commands
  - validate-{phase}: Execute {phase}-quality-gate.md checklist
  - show-results: Display quality gate results for current workflow
  - exit: Exit agent (confirm)

dependencies:
  checklists:
    - discovery-quality-gate.md
    - analyst-quality-gate.md
    - pm-quality-gate.md
    - architect-quality-gate.md
    - prp-quality-gate.md
  tasks:
    - execute-quality-gate.md

## Template Enhancement Pattern

When adding sections to templates:

1. Follow existing section structure:
   - id: section-identifier
     title: Human-Readable Title
     type: structured|table|bullet-list|code-block
     elicit: true|false
     skip_if: "Condition description"
     instruction: "What to include in this section"

2. For structured sections:
   components:
     - Component 1 description
     - Component 2 description

3. For table sections:
   columns: [Column1, Column2, Column3]
   rows:
     - Row identifier

4. For sections with elicitation:
   elicit: true
   # This triggers advanced-elicitation.md with 1-9 menu

5. For conditional sections:
   skip_if: "Backend-only project"
   # Quality gate will skip this section if condition met

## State Management Pattern

All state updates follow this pattern:

# Read current state
state = read_json('.codex/state/workflow.json')

# Update specific field
state['quality_gate_results']['pm'] = {
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "APPROVED",
  "score": 92,
  "evidence": [...]
}

# Atomic write (avoid corruption)
temp_file = '.codex/state/workflow.json.tmp'
write_json(temp_file, state)
rename(temp_file, '.codex/state/workflow.json')

## Critical Pattern: Zero-Knowledge Test

For PRP validation, apply this test:

"If I gave this PRP to a competent developer who knows NOTHING about this project,
could they implement it successfully using ONLY:
  1. The PRP content
  2. Access to the codebase files
  3. Their general programming knowledge
  4. NO additional context or clarification"

Validation items:
- [ ] All file paths are absolute and exist
- [ ] All commands are executable (not {{PLACEHOLDER}})
- [ ] All library versions are exact (not "latest")
- [ ] All patterns reference specific files with line numbers
- [ ] All gotchas are documented
- [ ] All validation commands are project-specific
- [ ] No assumptions of prior knowledge
- [ ] No "you know what I mean" statements

If answer is NO to any item: FAIL the PRP quality gate
```

### Integration Points

```yaml
# WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

# Before (Current State):
validate-phase.md checks: elicitation_completed[phase] == true
  ↓
  If true: Proceed to next phase
  If false: Block and request elicitation

# After (Phase 1 Complete):
validate-phase.md checks:
  1. elicitation_completed[phase] == true
  2. quality_gate_results[phase].status != "REJECTED"
  ↓
  If both true: Proceed to next phase
  If either false: Block with specific guidance
    - If elicitation incomplete: Request elicitation
    - If quality gate REJECTED: Display specific failures and required fixes
    - If quality gate CONDITIONAL: Display warnings, allow user to proceed or fix

# AGENT INTEGRATION

# Current workflow phase transitions:
discovery → analyst → pm → architect → prp-creator → dev

# Add quality gates:
discovery → [quality-gate validates discovery] → analyst
analyst → [quality-gate validates analyst] → pm
pm → [quality-gate validates pm] → architect
architect → [quality-gate validates architect] → prp-creator
prp-creator → [quality-gate validates prp] → dev

# Agent invocation pattern:
# After completing phase work, agent prompts:
"Phase {phase} document complete.
Run quality validation before proceeding? (recommended)
1. Yes - run quality-gate agent
2. No - proceed without validation (logged violation)
3. Review document first

Choose option: "

# TEMPLATE INTEGRATION

# Templates reference quality gates:
# In template YAML front matter:

validation:
  quality_gate: pm-quality-gate.md
  required_score: 70  # Minimum to proceed
  recommended_score: 90  # For high confidence

# Templates can check during elicitation:
# "This section validates against pm-quality-gate.md item 3.2"
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't skip evidence collection in quality gates - it's critical for validation
- ❌ Don't hardcode scoring thresholds - use quality-scoring-rubric.md
- ❌ Don't bypass quality gates in non-YOLO mode - defeats the purpose
- ❌ Don't create new state files - extend workflow.json.template
- ❌ Don't duplicate BMAD files - adapt them for CODEX
- ❌ Don't skip skip logic - frontend-only sections must be skippable
- ❌ Don't use * command prefix (BMAD style) - use slash commands (CODEX style)
- ❌ Don't add brownfield logic - Phase 1 is greenfield-only
- ❌ Don't create horizontal story slices - use vertical slice pattern
- ❌ Don't use vague validation like "looks good" - require specific evidence citations

---

## PRP Confidence Score: 9/10

**Rationale for high confidence:**
✅ Complete context from both BMAD (reference) and CODEX (target) implementations
✅ Exact file paths and line numbers for all patterns to follow
✅ Specific item counts for each checklist (15, 20, 90, 169, 30)
✅ Detailed scoring methodology documented
✅ Evidence-based validation approach defined
✅ Progressive validation at 4 levels (syntax, content, integration, E2E)
✅ State management patterns clearly specified
✅ Known gotchas documented with solutions
✅ Anti-patterns explicitly called out
✅ Time estimates grounded in analysis (70-89 hours total)

**Why not 10/10:**
⚠️ Actual checklist content requires domain expertise transfer from BMAD to CODEX
⚠️ Interactive mode implementation details not fully specified
⚠️ Agent persona and communication style need refinement during implementation

**Mitigation:**
- During implementation, reference BMAD checklists line-by-line for content accuracy
- Test interactive mode with real user to refine UX
- Iterate on agent persona based on user feedback

**Expected one-pass implementation success:** 85%
