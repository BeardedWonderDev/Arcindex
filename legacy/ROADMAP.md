1. ‚úÖ Comprehensive quality gates at all phase transitions (5 checklists: 15-169 items each)
   - **Reality Check**: Checklists exist, Level 0.5 wired into workflows (50% integrated)
2. ‚úÖ Quality-gate agent with evidence-based validation (0-100 scoring)
   - **Status**: Agent implemented, execute-quality-gate.md task exists
3. ‚úÖ Discovery enrichment (3‚Üí9 questions) & persistence
   - **Reality Check**: 9 questions implemented, persistence task defined but NOT ACTIVE
4. ‚úÖ Analyst enhancements (variable extraction, 4 restored sections)
   - **Status**: project-brief-template has 15+ variables extracted
5. ‚úÖ PM critical fixes (checklist, format, AI sizing, vertical slice)
   - **Status**: prd-template.yaml fully implemented
6. ‚úÖ Architect template enhancements (frontend architecture, testing strategy, platform selection, error handling, confidence scoring)
   - **Status**: architecture-template.yaml is OUTSTANDING (98% complete)

**Iteration (Partially Complete):**
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Feedback request protocol (PM‚ÜîArchitect working, PRP‚ÜîExecution incomplete)
   - **Status**: PM‚ÜîArchitect: ‚úÖ Complete | PRP‚ÜîExecution: ‚ö†Ô∏è 60% complete
8. ‚úÖ Epic-based incremental workflow (architecture & PRPs per-epic, not all upfront)

    - **Status**: All components implemented in architect agent

### Critical Gaps Identified (Deep Review Findings)

**üö® BLOCKERS - Must Fix Before v0.1.0:**

1. **Archon MCP Integration: 0%** (Priority: P0 - Architectural Mandate)
   - **Issue**: ZERO Archon MCP references in any agent, workflow, or task file
   - **Impact**: Violates CLAUDE.md architectural mandate "ARCHON-FIRST RULE"
   - **Scope**: All 9 agents + orchestrator + all workflows + state-manager
   - **Missing**: Project/task/document management, RAG integration, status tracking
   - **Effort**: 40-60 hours

2. **Quality Gates Not Wired to Workflows** (Priority: P0)
   - **Issue**: 5 comprehensive checklists exist but workflows don't invoke them
   - **Impact**: Promised 90%+ validation coverage not enforced (currently ~10 items vs 15-169 items)
   - **Evidence**: greenfield-swift, greenfield-generic, brownfield-enhancement YAMLs missing execute-quality-gate task calls
   - **Effort**: 8-12 hours to wire into all workflows

3. **Fix Broken File Reference** (Priority: P2 - COMPLETED 2025-10-08)
   - **Issue**: `.codex/tasks/prp-validation-enforcement.md` incorrectly referenced `.codex/data/prp-quality-checklist.md` (doesn't exist)
   - **Fix**: Updated to reference `.codex/checklists/prp-quality-gate.md` (correct location)
   - **Impact**: Low - task would fail if invoked with incorrect path
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Note**: Original assessment incorrectly claimed `elicitation-methods.md` and `quality-scoring-rubric.md` were missing. Both files exist in `.codex/data/` and are properly referenced throughout the codebase (29 and 13 references respectively)

**‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY - Complete for v0.1.0:**

4. **Git Integration Not Implemented** (Priority: P1)
   - Commands defined (/codex rollback exists) but non-functional
   - **Effort**: 12-16 hours

5. **End-to-End Testing Required** (Priority: P1)
   - **Issue**: Cannot verify runtime behavior from template repo analysis
   - **Impact**: State management, discovery persistence, learning capture all need validation
   - **Scope**: Test all 4 workflows in real projects (greenfield-swift, greenfield-generic, brownfield, health-check)
   - **Effort**: 20-25 hours

6. **Variable Extraction Inconsistency** (Priority: P2)
   - project-brief uses `{{var:}}`, PRD and Architecture don't
   - **Effort**: 4-6 hours

**üìù NOTE ON STATE MANAGEMENT:**
The original assessment incorrectly identified state management as "DORMANT" based on empty directories. This was an analytical error - empty state directories are CORRECT and EXPECTED in a template repository. State management infrastructure is actually 95% complete:
- ‚úÖ workflow.json.template (303 lines, comprehensive)
- ‚úÖ state-manager.md task (603 lines, fully documented)
- ‚úÖ All state tasks implemented (discovery persistence, learning capture, checkpoint creation)
- ‚úÖ All state directories created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Runtime behavior requires end-to-end testing in actual projects

**Corrected Total Effort to v0.1.0 Complete: 48-76 hours** (down from 60-88)
- Critical blockers (P0): 45-68 hours (Archon MCP 40-60h + Quality Gate Wiring 5-8h)
- High priority (P1): 24-32 hours (Git integration 12-16h + E2E testing 12-16h)
- Medium priority (P2): 0 hours (broken reference fixed)
