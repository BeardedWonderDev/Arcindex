## How to Use Phase 2 Features

### Daily Operations

**When encountering ambiguity in architecture:**
```bash
# Architect agent
*request-feedback pm "Story 1.3 unclear: 'real-time' latency not specified"

# PM agent (after resolution)
*update docs/prd.md
*resolve-feedback fb-XXX "Clarified: real-time = <100ms response time"
```

**Before starting PRP execution:**
```bash
# Dev agent (automatic or manual)
PRP_FILE="PRPs/epic-1-story-1.md"
bash .codex/tasks/prp-validation-enforcement.md

# Fix any issues until score ‚â• 90
```

**Between epics:**
```bash
# After Epic 1 complete, before Epic 2 starts
COMPLETED_EPIC=1
NEXT_EPIC=2
bash .codex/tasks/epic-learning-integration.md

# Review learning summary
cat .codex/state/epic-learnings/epic-1-learning-summary.md
```

**Architecture validation:**
```bash
# After architecture draft
bash .codex/tasks/zero-knowledge-test.md  # Target: ‚â•95% completeness
bash .codex/tasks/confidence-scoring.md   # Target: ‚â•85/100 confidence
```
