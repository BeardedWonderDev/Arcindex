# CODEX Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Achieve "one-pass implementation success" through zero prior knowledge architecture
- Replace fragmented BMAD + PRP workflow with unified CODEX orchestration
- Enable context window liberation through strategic document-driven breakpoints
- Integrate language-specific agents seamlessly into development workflow
- Reduce development cycle time by 40% through automated quality assurance
- Support complex features (>2000 lines) without context overflow
- Establish repeatable, standardized AI-assisted development patterns

### Background Context
CODEX addresses the critical fragmentation in current AI-assisted development workflows where developers manually coordinate between BMAD documentation commands and PRP implementation prompts, leading to context loss and inconsistent quality. By implementing a "zero prior knowledge" architecture with strategic breakpoints, CODEX enables each development phase to execute independently with fresh context windows, solving the fundamental constraint of AI token limitations through architectural design rather than workarounds. The system orchestrates proven methodologies into a seamless workflow that maintains complete context throughout the development lifecycle while automatically leveraging specialized language-specific agents for quality enhancement.

1. **Add Data Specifications:** Include JSON schema for workflow state files
2. **Define Monitoring:** Specify how agent failures are detected and reported
3. **Quantify Current Performance:** Measure BMAD workflow times for comparison
4. **Create Visual Workflow:** Add diagram showing phase transitions
5. **Document Migration Path:** Create step-by-step BMAD to CODEX migration guide

### Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The identified improvements are non-blocking and can be addressed during architecture phase.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Please activate as the UX Expert agent and review the CODEX PRD at docs/prd.md to create a comprehensive UI/UX specification. Focus on the developer experience within the Claude Code CLI environment, defining interaction patterns, command feedback styles, progress visualization approaches, and error handling interfaces that make complex multi-agent workflows feel seamless and intuitive. Consider the CLI-based nature of the tool and how to best present information, guide users through workflows, and handle the complexity of parallel agent execution while maintaining clarity.

### Architect Prompt
Please activate as the Architect agent and review the CODEX PRD at docs/prd.md to create a detailed technical architecture document. Specify the agent communication protocols, YAML workflow schema definitions, state management structures, validation gate implementations, and integration patterns with existing Claude Code tools and MCP servers. Ensure the system can achieve the "zero prior knowledge" goal while maintaining backward compatibility with BMAD patterns. Pay special attention to the areas identified in the checklist report: workflow state JSON schemas, monitoring/alerting for agent failures, and optimal YAML structures for workflow definitions.
